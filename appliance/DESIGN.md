# VM Appliance Design

A minimal Alpine Linux VM image with Incus pre-installed, built from a declarative recipe. Serves two purposes:

1. **Integration testing on CI** -- boots in GitHub Actions via QEMU/KVM to validate the full system (Incus daemon, networking) rather than mocking
2. **macOS support** -- runs as an invisible Linux VM via Apple Virtualization.framework so macOS users get native Incus containers

## Build Pipeline

`build.sh` avoids tools that require block devices or KVM. The entire build runs inside a chroot, making it portable across CI runners, containers, and bare metal:

1. Download the Alpine Linux minirootfs from the official CDN
2. Extract rootfs to a temporary directory
3. Copy overlay files (`root/`) into the rootfs
4. Install packages via chroot (`apk add --no-cache`)
5. Run `config.sh` to strip bloat and configure the appliance
6. Clean stale state (`/run/*`, `/var/lib/incus/*`) to prevent PID/lock file issues on first boot
7. Pack the rootfs into a zstd-compressed tarball (`rootfs.tar.zst`)
8. Build a custom minimal kernel from vanilla kernel.org source (`kernel/build-kernel.sh`)

Output artifacts: `vmlinuz` (~11 MB), `rootfs.tar.zst` (~30-40 MB). No initrd.

No disk images are created during build -- the tarball is unpacked into a btrfs disk image on first use (see Disk Lifecycle below).

## Custom Kernel

The appliance uses a custom kernel built from vanilla kernel.org source (`kernel/build-kernel.sh`). Every required driver and subsystem is compiled built-in -- there are no loadable modules and no initrd. The kernel boots directly to the root filesystem.

### Config Fragment (`kernel/isx.config`)

Applied on top of `allnoconfig` via `merge_config.sh`. Both x86_64 and aarch64 options are included in a single fragment; irrelevant options are silently ignored by kconfig.

**Enabled (built-in)**:
- **Virtio**: PCI, MMIO, block, network, console, balloon, vsock (host↔VM API tunnel)
- **Filesystems**: btrfs, overlayfs (Incus containers), fuse (lxcfs), tmpfs, procfs, sysfs, devtmpfs
- **Networking**: TCP/UDP/IPv4/IPv6, UNIX sockets, packet sockets, bridge (with VLAN filtering), veth, macvlan, 802.1Q VLANs, netfilter/iptables (NAT, REDIRECT, CHECKSUM, MASQUERADE, conntrack)
- **Container isolation**: all namespace types (including time), cgroups v2 (cpu with CFS bandwidth, io with iocost, memory with zswap, pids, cpuset, hugetlb), seccomp
- **Console**: serial 8250 (ttyS0), AMBA PL011 (ttyAMA0), HVC (hvc0)
- **Block**: loop devices (Incus btrfs storage pool)
- **System**: POSIX timers, file locking, BPF JIT, audit

**Stripped at compile time**:
- All hardware drivers except virtio (no SCSI, SATA, NVMe, USB, GPU, sound, wireless, bluetooth, input, I2C, SPI, GPIO, DMA, IOMMU, hwmon, media, InfiniBand, firewire, thunderbolt, NFC)
- CPU mitigations (`CONFIG_CPU_MITIGATIONS=n`) -- trusted appliance VM; untrusted workloads are isolated in Incus containers
- All filesystems except btrfs, overlayfs, fuse, tmpfs, proc, sysfs, devtmpfs
- All network protocols except TCP/UDP/IPv4/IPv6/UNIX/packet/netlink
- Module support, initrd support, kexec, hibernation, suspend, RAID/MD/DM, ftrace/kprobes

### Config Validation

`build-kernel.sh` validates the config fragment after applying it: every `CONFIG_*=y` option is checked against the generated `.config`. Options silently dropped by kconfig (unknown name or unmet dependency) are reported as warnings. Arch-specific options (e.g., ARM64 UART on x86) are expected to be absent on the other architecture and are harmless.

Key dependencies discovered during development:
- `CONFIG_64BIT=y` -- `allnoconfig` on x86 defaults to 32-bit
- `CONFIG_FILE_LOCKING=y` -- required by lxcfs PID file locking; without it `flock()` returns ENOSYS
- `CONFIG_POSIX_TIMERS=y` -- required by dbus metrics; without it `clock_gettime()` fails with assertion crash
- `CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED=y` -- dependency for `CONFIG_CFS_BANDWIDTH` (cgroup cpu.weight/cpu.max)
- `CONFIG_VLAN_8021Q=y` -- dependency for `CONFIG_BRIDGE_VLAN_FILTERING` (Incus bridge)
- `CONFIG_NETFILTER_XTABLES_LEGACY=y` -- dependency for iptables filter/nat/mangle in kernel 7.x
- `CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_CHECKSUM=y` -- required by Incus for DHCP checksum fixup on bridge

### Root Device

Without initrd, the kernel can't resolve `root=LABEL=...` (label resolution requires udev). The kernel cmdline uses `root=/dev/vda` instead -- the virtio-blk device is always `/dev/vda` since there is exactly one disk. `CONFIG_DEVTMPFS_MOUNT=y` ensures `/dev/vda` exists at boot.

The cmdline also passes `rootfstype=btrfs`. Without it the kernel probes `fuseblk` (we ship FUSE for virtiofs/lxcfs) before `btrfs` at root mount, which prints a harmless `fuseblk: Unknown parameter 'commit'` since `fuseblk` rejects the `commit` rootflag. `rootfstype=btrfs` skips the probing. It must live on the bootloader cmdline, not the kernel's built-in `CONFIG_CMDLINE`: arm64 only offers `CMDLINE_FROM_BOOTLOADER`/`CMDLINE_FORCE` (no `EXTEND`), so a built-in line is ignored once a bootloader cmdline is present, and `FORCE` would discard the dynamic `isx.*` params. Mitigations, by contrast, *are* compiled off (`CONFIG_CPU_MITIGATIONS=n`), so no `mitigations=off` is passed.

### Expected Console Warnings

These appear during boot and are **expected** — deliberate tradeoffs, not faults:

- **`AppArmor support has been disabled because of lack of kernel support`** — the minimal kernel omits `CONFIG_SECURITY_APPARMOR`. Container isolation relies on the VM boundary, user namespaces, and seccomp; we do not ship AppArmor (it would also require the `apparmor` userspace). A deliberate choice for this single-tenant dev appliance.
- **`Instance type not operational … KVM support is missing (no /dev/kvm)`** — there is no nested virtualization (the host hypervisor, e.g. Apple Virtualization.framework, does not expose it). `isx` launches **containers**, not nested VMs, so this is irrelevant. Not fixable in the guest kernel.
- **`Couldn't find the CGroup memory swap accounting, swap limits will be ignored`** — **misleading**. The kernel has `CONFIG_MEMCG` + `CONFIG_SWAP`, and `memory.swap.*` files are present in cgroup v2 (verified), so swap limits do work. This is a conservative false-negative in the incus/LXC probe.

## Init System

The appliance uses **BusyBox init** as PID 1, not systemd or OpenRC. This is the simplest possible init for a single-purpose appliance:

- **`/etc/inittab`** -- declares the boot sequence (`sysinit`), shutdown handler, and serial console gettys (`respawn`)
- **`/etc/init.d/rcS`** -- linear startup script that starts services in dependency order
- **`/etc/init.d/rcK`** -- graceful shutdown script

BusyBox init handles PID 1 responsibilities (zombie reaping, signal forwarding) and automatically respawns gettys on serial consoles. The startup script is ~50 lines and the service ordering is fixed — no dependency resolver needed.

### Boot Sequence (`rcS`)

1. Mount virtual filesystems (`/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`, `/dev/pts`, `/dev/shm`, `/run`, `/tmp`)
2. Remount root with `noatime,commit=300`
3. Set hostname
4. Apply sysctl settings (IP forwarding for Incus bridge NAT)
5. Bring up loopback and DHCP on the first network interface (`udhcpc`)
6. Seed clock from kernel cmdline (`isx.time`) and start `qemu-ga` for vfkit timesync
7. Start `chronyd` for NTP clock sync (see [Clock Synchronization](#clock-synchronization))
8. Start `dbus-daemon` (required by Incus)
9. Start `lxcfs` (required by Incus for /proc virtualization)
10. Start `incusd`
11. Run `incus-spawn-vm-init` (bridge, storage pool, iptables)
12. Run smoke test if `isx.smoke_test` is on kernel cmdline
13. Schedule diagnostics dump (30s delay, background)
14. Echo `=== ISX READY ===` marker

### Clock Synchronization

The VM has no hardware RTC. Three layers keep the guest clock accurate:

1. **Boot-time seed**: The kernel cmdline carries `isx.time=<epoch>` (stamped by the host at VM start). `rcS` sets the system clock from this immediately, so TLS works before NTP is reachable.

2. **QEMU Guest Agent (vfkit)**: `qemu-ga` listens on virtio-vsock port 1024. vfkit's `--timesync` is supposed to send `guest-set-time` on host wake, but does not do so reliably after macOS sleep. This layer is kept as a best-effort complement.

3. **chrony (NTP)**: `chronyd` polls `pool.ntp.org` and steps the clock whenever the offset exceeds 1 second (`makestep 1 -1`). After a host sleep, the guest network recovers within ~30 seconds (udhcpc DHCP), then chrony detects the drift and corrects it within a few seconds via `iburst`. This is the primary post-resume clock correction mechanism and works regardless of vfkit behavior.

On QEMU with KVM, `kvmclock` (CONFIG_PARAVIRT_CLOCK) keeps the guest in sync natively. chrony provides an additional safety net and handles non-KVM QEMU scenarios.

## Image Stripping

Alpine Linux is minimal by default — no GPU libraries, QEMU tools, or scripting runtimes are pulled in as Incus dependencies. `config.sh` performs light cleanup:

- Strip debug symbols from binaries and shared libraries
- Remove `/boot/*` and `/usr/lib/modules` (custom kernel is built separately)
- Remove man pages, docs, locale data
- Remove `apk` package manager (appliance is immutable)

## Disk Lifecycle

Disk images are not created during build. Instead, the rootfs tarball is unpacked into a btrfs disk image on first use. This two-stage approach avoids the need for block devices during build and lets each environment choose its own disk size.

**On macOS** (via `podman machine ssh`):
```
truncate -s 60G disk.img
mkfs.btrfs -q -L isxroot disk.img        # formats file directly, no loop device
sudo mount -o loop disk.img /mnt          # kernel creates loop device via loop-control
sudo tar xf rootfs.tar.zst -C /mnt
sudo chmod 755 /mnt                       # container rootfs has 700 on /
sudo umount /mnt
```

**On Linux** (direct):
```
truncate -s $SIZE disk.img
LOOP=$(losetup --find --show disk.img)
mkfs.btrfs -q -L isxroot $LOOP
mount $LOOP /mnt && tar xf rootfs.tar.zst -C /mnt
chmod 755 /mnt
umount /mnt && losetup -d $LOOP
```

The `chmod 755` is required because the container rootfs root directory has `drwx------` (700) permissions, which prevents any non-root service from traversing the filesystem.

Disk images are sparse: a 60 GB image consumes ~540 MB actual disk space on APFS (macOS) or any CoW filesystem.

## Boot Backends

### vfkit (macOS)

Uses Apple Virtualization.framework via [vfkit](https://github.com/crc-org/vfkit). Direct kernel boot with virtio devices:

```
vfkit --cpus 2 --memory 2048 \
  --bootloader linux,kernel=vmlinuz,cmdline="root=/dev/vda rw rootflags=commit=300 console=hvc0 quiet" \
  --device virtio-blk,path=disk.img \
  --device virtio-net,nat \
  --device virtio-serial,logFilePath=vm.log \
  --device virtio-vsock,port=8443,socketURL=~/.local/state/incus-spawn/vm.incus.sock,connect \
  --restful-uri tcp://localhost:$PORT
```

- No initrd -- kernel has all drivers built-in
- Console on `hvc0` (virtio-serial), not `ttyS0`
- REST API for lifecycle management (stop via `POST /vm/state {"state":"Stop"}`)
- NAT networking with DHCP (interface appears as `enp0s1`)
- **vsock tunnel**: the `virtio-vsock` device exposes the VM's vsock port 8443 as a Unix domain socket on the host. Inside the VM, socat bridges this to the Incus daemon's Unix socket, giving the host direct plain-HTTP access to the Incus API without TCP or TLS. This bypasses corporate VPN socket filters (e.g. Cisco AnyConnect) that block non-Apple-signed binaries from TCP connections to the VM subnet

### QEMU (Linux / CI)

Architecture-aware with KVM acceleration when available:

- **x86_64**: `-machine pc`, `-cpu host -enable-kvm` when `/dev/kvm` exists
- **aarch64**: `-machine virt`, `-cpu host -enable-kvm` when `/dev/kvm` exists
- Console: `ttyS0` (x86_64) or `ttyAMA0` (aarch64)

## VM Management (`vm.sh`)

Lifecycle script with subcommands: `start`, `stop`, `status`, `console`.

**State files** in `~/.local/state/incus-spawn/`:
- `disk.img` -- btrfs disk image (created on first start)
- `vm.pid` -- vfkit/QEMU process ID
- `vm.log` -- serial console output
- `vm.rest-uri` -- vfkit REST API endpoint (macOS only)
- `vm.incus.sock` -- vsock Unix socket for Incus API (macOS/vfkit only, created by vfkit, cleaned up on stop)

**Configuration** via environment variables (overrides adaptive defaults):
- `ISX_VM_DISK` -- disk size (default: `60G`)
- `ISX_VM_CPUS` -- vCPU count (default: host cores - 2, minimum 1)
- `ISX_VM_MEMORY` -- memory in MiB (default: 60% of host RAM, minimum 2048)
- `ISX_GATEWAY` -- Incus bridge gateway IP (default: `10.166.11.1`), passed via kernel cmdline
- `ISX_MITM_PORT` -- MITM proxy port (default: `18443`), passed via kernel cmdline
- `APPLIANCE_DIR` -- path to build artifacts (default: `appliance/build`)

**Stop sequence** (graceful shutdown):
1. Send stop request via REST API (vfkit only)
2. Wait up to 5 seconds for process to exit
3. `SIGTERM`, wait 1 second
4. `SIGKILL` as last resort

## First-Boot Initialization

`incus-spawn-vm-init` runs from `rcS` after `incusd` is started. It reads configuration from kernel command line parameters (`isx.gateway`, `isx.mitm_port`, `isx.shared`, `isx.vsock_incus`) and:

1. Waits for DNS readiness (nameserver entry in `/etc/resolv.conf`, populated by `udhcpc`)
2. Waits for the Incus daemon to become ready (up to 30 seconds)
3. Creates the `incusbr0` bridge network with the configured gateway IP and NAT
4. Creates a btrfs storage pool (`cow`) backed by a loop file, adaptively sized (half of free disk, capped at 30 GB, minimum 1 GB)
5. Installs an iptables PREROUTING redirect rule (port 443 -> MITM proxy port) on the bridge interface
6. Starts the vsock forwarder if `isx.vsock_incus` is set (socat bridges vsock port to `/var/lib/incus/unix.socket`)
7. Symlinks the `isx` binary from the shared directory if available

On subsequent boots, the script detects existing configuration and skips creation steps.

## Testing

### Local (`test-boot.sh`)

Boots the appliance image and verifies three checks:

1. Btrfs root filesystem mounted
2. Incus daemon activated
3. Appliance ready (`ISX READY` marker — implies network, bridge, and storage pool all succeeded)

Backend selection: vfkit on macOS, QEMU on Linux (with KVM when available). Creates a 4 GB test disk from the rootfs tarball if one doesn't already exist.

### CI (`.github/workflows/`)

**Build** (`build-appliance.yml`): separate jobs for x86_64 (`ubuntu-latest`) and aarch64 (`ubuntu-24.04-arm`). Artifacts cached by content hash of `appliance/**` files. Includes kernel compilation (~3-5 minutes with minimal config).

**Integration** (`test-integration.yml`): restores cached build artifacts, creates a btrfs disk image from the tarball, boots via QEMU with KVM, verifies the VM reaches `ISX READY` state, and runs the Incus smoke test.

### Smoke Test

`incus-spawn-smoke-test` runs from `rcS` when the kernel cmdline parameter `isx.smoke_test=1` is present. It verifies:

1. Incus daemon is responsive (`incus info`)
2. Storage pool `cow` exists
3. Bridge `incusbr0` exists
4. Container creation works (if image server is reachable)

Output goes to the serial console as `=== SMOKE TEST PASSED ===` or `=== SMOKE TEST FAILED: <reason> ===`. CI checks for this marker.

## Services

The appliance runs a minimal set of daemons, started sequentially by `rcS`:

- **udhcpc** — DHCP on the virtio-net interface (BusyBox built-in)
- **dbus-daemon** — D-Bus system bus (required by Incus)
- **lxcfs** — per-container /proc virtualization (required by Incus)
- **incusd** — container daemon
- **getty** — serial console for debugging (respawned by BusyBox init)

No SSH, no syslog daemon, no logind, no polkit. The appliance is headless and accessed only through the Incus API.

## Boot Timeline

With the custom kernel (no initrd, no modules), musl libc, and BusyBox init on bare metal with KVM:

```
0.73s   rcS starts (kernel → init → mount filesystems)
0.81s   network up (udhcpc DHCP lease)
0.82s   incusd forked
2.35s   ISX READY (incusd ready, bridge configured, storage pool online)
```

First boot is ~3.9s (creates bridge and storage pool). Subsequent boots are ~2.4s (skips creation).

The 1.5s gap between incusd fork and ISX READY is `incus admin waitready` — Go runtime and SQLite database initialization. This is the floor.

## Boot Diagnostics

`incus-spawn-diag` collects diagnostic information: process list, kernel messages, Incus status, network interfaces, and DNS configuration.

Two ways to run it:

- **From the host** (no login required): `sudo ./appliance/diag.sh` — boots in diagnostic mode, prints results, exits. Disk is not modified.
- **From inside the VM**: `incus-spawn-diag`
- **On smoke test failure**: diagnostics are dumped automatically.

## Debugging

### Interactive serial console

```
sudo ./appliance/vm.sh shell
```

Boots the VM with an interactive serial console. Log in as `root` (no password). Exit with `Ctrl-A X`. Requires stopping a background VM first (`vm.sh stop`).

### Manual QEMU boot

For full control, boot QEMU directly:

```
sudo qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -machine pc -enable-kvm -cpu host \
  -m 2048 -nographic -no-reboot -nodefaults -serial stdio \
  -kernel appliance/build/vmlinuz \
  -drive file=appliance/build/disk.img,format=raw,if=virtio \
  -netdev user,id=net0 -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=net0 \
  -append "root=/dev/vda rw console=ttyS0"
```

Note: the `-netdev` line is required for `incus-spawn-vm-init` to succeed -- without networking, dnsmasq cannot bind its DHCP socket to the bridge interface.

### Inspecting the disk image

```
sudo mount -o loop appliance/build/disk.img /mnt/isx-disk
# inspect files...
sudo umount /mnt/isx-disk
```

If mount fails with "failed to setup loop device", clean stale loop devices first: `sudo losetup -D`

### Creating a fresh disk from tarball

```
sudo bash -c '
truncate -s 4G appliance/build/disk.img
LOOP=$(losetup --find --show appliance/build/disk.img)
mkfs.btrfs -q -L isxroot "$LOOP"
mkdir -p /mnt/isx-disk
mount "$LOOP" /mnt/isx-disk
zstd -d appliance/build/rootfs.tar.zst --stdout | tar xf - -C /mnt/isx-disk
chmod 755 /mnt/isx-disk
umount /mnt/isx-disk
losetup -d "$LOOP"
'
```

### Kernel config validation

After modifying `kernel/isx.config`, validate for both architectures in a container:

```
podman run --rm -v $PWD/appliance:/appliance:ro fedora:44 bash -c '
dnf install -y -q make gcc flex bison bc findutils
tar xf /appliance/build/linux-*.tar.xz -C /tmp/ks --strip-components=1
cd /tmp/ks
for ARCH in x86 arm64; do
    echo "=== $ARCH ==="
    KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG=/appliance/kernel/isx.config make -s ARCH=$ARCH allnoconfig
    make -s ARCH=$ARCH olddefconfig
    grep "^CONFIG_" /appliance/kernel/isx.config | grep "=y" | while read line; do
        key=${line%%=*}
        grep -q "^${key}=y" .config || echo "  NOT APPLIED: $line"
    done
done
'
```

Arch-specific options (ARM64 UART on x86, ACPI on arm64, KERNEL_ZSTD on arm64) are expected to be absent on the other architecture.

### Enabling auto-login (`enable-console.sh`)

Patches a disk image for auto-login shell on serial consoles (bypasses BusyBox `login`):

```
sudo ./enable-console.sh appliance/build/disk.img
```

Modifies `/etc/inittab` getty entries to use `-n -l /bin/sh` flags and removes the root password. After patching, boot with QEMU `-serial stdio` and press Enter to get a root shell.
