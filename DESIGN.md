# incus-spawn Design Document

A CLI tool for managing isolated Incus-based development environments. System containers that behave like bare-metal Linux machines, designed for safely running untrusted AI agents and external reproducers in OSS projects.

## Why not Docker?

Docker and Podman are **application containers**: they isolate a single process with a minimal filesystem, no init system, and restricted networking. This is ideal for deploying microservices but poor for development environments where you need:

- A real init system (systemd) for services like podman socket, sshd, or dbus
- Full networking: `ping`, `traceroute`, `tcpdump`, DNS resolution that works like a real machine
- Nested containers: running Podman/Docker inside the environment (Testcontainers, CI pipelines)
- Debugging tools: `strace`, `perf`, `gdb` — all require capabilities or sysctls that Docker strips
- GUI applications via Wayland passthrough with GPU acceleration, and audio via PipeWire

Incus **system containers** run a full Linux userspace with their own init, networking stack, and process tree. They share the host kernel (like Docker) but present as a complete machine rather than a process jail. For stronger isolation, Incus also supports KVM virtual machines with a separate kernel, at the cost of a modest performance overhead.

The tradeoff: system containers are heavier than application containers (~200MB base vs ~5MB Alpine). This is acceptable for development environments that persist for hours or days, and copy-on-write storage means clones are cheap regardless of base image size.

## Goals

- **Secure by default**: isolated environments that prevent untrusted code from accessing host credentials or resources
- **Bare-metal experience**: containers with full init, real networking, working developer tools — developers shouldn't notice they're inside a container
- **Extensible without Java**: image definitions and tool installations defined in YAML; Java only needed for tools requiring programmatic logic
- **Ephemeral and cheap**: copy-on-write clones mean spinning up a new environment costs seconds and minimal disk space
- **Familiar**: CLI patterns inspired by git workflows (branch-name-style naming, auto-detection from cwd)
- **Idempotent setup**: `isx init` can be re-run safely at any time — each step checks whether its work is already done and skips without making changes, never disrupting running containers or reloading services unnecessarily

## Tech Stack

- **Quarkus CLI** with picocli extension
- **Tamboui** (https://tamboui.dev/) for interactive TUI (list view, modal dialogs, inline actions)
- **GraalVM native image** for optional zero-dependency distribution
- **JBang** for easy installation (`jbang app install isx`)

## Architecture

### Container Model

- **System containers** by default (lightweight, full init system), with `--vm` flag for KVM VMs (stronger isolation, separate kernel)
- Containers don't drop capabilities (`lxc.cap.drop =`) and relax kernel paranoia (`ptrace_scope`, `perf_event_paranoid`, `ping_group_range`) to match bare-metal behaviour
- No GUI by default; Wayland + GPU passthrough available at branch time
- Three network modes at branch time: full internet (default), proxy-only, or airgapped
- Container user: `agentuser` (UID 1000, passwordless sudo)

### Template Image Hierarchy

Images are defined in YAML and layered via copy-on-write. Built-in definitions live in `src/main/resources/images/*.yaml`; user-defined images in `~/.config/incus-spawn/images/` can extend or override them:

```
tpl-minimal   (Base OS only — no tools)
  └── tpl-dev   (Podman, GitHub CLI, Claude Code)
        └── tpl-java  (JDK packages + Maven tool)
```

Additional Java tools available: `pi` (Pi coding agent). Not included in built-in templates; users can add it to custom image definitions.

Each image definition specifies:
- `name` — container name (required)
- `description` — human-readable description for the TUI
- `image` — base OS image, only for root images
- `image_url` — download URL for the base image tarball (supports `{arch}` and `{tag}` placeholders)
- `image_tag` — release tag identifying the base image version
- `image_sha256` — per-architecture checksums for integrity verification
- `type` — instance type: `container` (default), `vm`, or `kvm`. Inherits through the parent chain via `inheritTypes()` at load time
- `vm_image_url` — download URL for the VM base image (qcow2 tarball, supports `{arch}` and `{tag}` placeholders)
- `vm_image_sha256` — per-architecture checksums for the VM base image
- `parent` — parent image name (omit for root images)
- `packages` — dnf packages to install
- `tools` — tool names to run (resolved from YAML or Java)

Building an image automatically builds missing parents recursively. `isx build --all` rebuilds every defined image from scratch.

**Base image**: The root image (`tpl-minimal`) uses a custom Fedora base image
from [`Sanne/incus-spawn-images`](https://github.com/Sanne/incus-spawn-images)
instead of linuxcontainers.org. This image is a pre-baked systemd rootfs with
agentuser, systemd-networkd, a connectivity watchdog, container-specific service
masking, and a tmpfiles override for device node permissions — all the static
setup that `buildFromScratch` would otherwise perform on every build. A separate
VM base image (`vm_image_url`) is also available — a stock Incus Fedora VM image
customized with the same base configuration via `virt-customize`. The base image
tag and SHA256 checksums are pinned in `src/main/resources/images/minimal.yaml`.
`isx update-base` manages base image versions: it fetches the release list from
the GitHub API, retrieves per-architecture SHA256 checksums, and writes a
user-level override to `~/.config/incus-spawn/images/minimal.yaml` when pinning.
`--latest` removes the override so the built-in definition (updated with each isx
release) is used. See the [incus-spawn-images README](https://github.com/Sanne/incus-spawn-images#releasing-a-new-version)
for the full release process.

**Resolution order** (later overrides earlier): built-in YAML (classpath) → user-defined YAML (`~/.config/incus-spawn/images/`) → search paths (`searchPaths` in config.yaml) → project-local (`.incus-spawn/images/`). Definitions with the same name from a later source override earlier ones.

### Tool System

Tools define how software gets installed into template images. Two formats:

**YAML tools** (primary format) — declarative, no Java needed:

```yaml
name: maven-3
description: Apache Maven (latest 3.x)
run:
  - |
    MAVEN_VERSION=$(curl -s https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/ ...)
    ...
verify: mvn --version
```

Schema fields (all optional except `name`):
- `packages` — dnf install
- `downloads` — artifacts to download, cache on the host, and extract into the container (with optional SHA256 verification and symlink creation)
- `requires` — list of other tool names that must be installed first (resolved transitively)
- `run` — shell commands as root
- `run_as_user` — shell commands as agentuser
- `files` — files to write (path, content, optional owner)
- `env` — environment variables written to `/etc/profile.d/isx-env.sh` (supports structured entries with merge strategies)
- `verify` — verification command (logged, non-fatal)

Execution order: packages → downloads → run → run_as_user → files → verify. Environment variables are collected centrally after all tools run.

**Environment variable system** (`EnvEntry` + `EnvResolver`): Env entries from the full template parent chain and all tools are collected by `BuildCommand.writeEnvFile()` into a single `/etc/profile.d/isx-env.sh`. Four strategies: `set` (unconditional), `set-if-unset` (conditional default), `prepend`/`append` (additive with separator). Conflict detection: two `set` entries for the same variable with different values fail the build with both sources named. Templates (`ImageDef`) can also declare env entries. Java tools participate via `ToolSetup.envEntries()`. Raw shell strings are still accepted for backward compatibility.

**Transitive dependency resolution** (`requires`): Tools can declare dependencies on other tools. During build, `resolveWithDeps()` performs a recursive depth-first traversal to build the full dependency graph. Circular dependencies are detected and reported. Auto-added dependencies are logged: "Auto-adding dependency: sshd (required by idea-backend)". Dependencies are installed before the tools that require them.

**Java tools** (fallback) — for tools needing programmatic logic beyond what YAML supports:
- Implement `ToolSetup` interface (`name()` + `install(Container, Map<String, String>)` + `envEntries(Map<String, String>)`)
- Discovered via CDI (`@Dependent`)
- Currently used by: `claude` (binary install + settings), `gh` (dnf install), `pi` (npm install + settings)

**Resolution order** (later overrides earlier): built-in YAML (`resources/tools/`) → user-defined YAML (`~/.config/incus-spawn/tools/`) → search paths → project-local (`.incus-spawn/tools/`). A YAML tool with the same name replaces any earlier definition. Java CDI implementations (`@Dependent` beans) are used as fallback when no YAML tool matches.

### Build Flow

**`buildFromScratch` (root image, no parent):**
1. Import and launch base image (pre-baked with agentuser, systemd-networkd, service masks)
2. Install MITM proxy CA certificate
3. Configure security (idmap, nesting, syscall interception, no capability dropping) — *skipped for VMs*
4. Prepare container for package install (tmpfiles overrides, temporary DHCP network config, man dirs) — *skipped for VMs*
5. Configure DNS (disable systemd-resolved, point at Incus bridge gateway)
6. Upgrade system packages
7. Install image-defined packages via dnf
8. Install image-defined tools (resolved from YAML/Java)
9. Clone declared repos (with reference optimization — see below)
10. Configure terminal title (`PROMPT_COMMAND` in `.bashrc` sets `isx:<hostname>`)
11. Pre-trust cloned repo directories in `.claude.json` (if Claude Code is installed)
12. Clean caches (dnf, /tmp)
13. Tag metadata (version, SHA, definition fingerprint, CA fingerprint, build source), stop

**VM-specific build behavior:**

When `type` is `vm` or `kvm` (set in the definition or via `--type`), `buildFromScratch` applies the entire ancestor tool/package chain from YAML definitions alone — parent Incus instances are not needed, so container parent rebuilds are skipped when a type change is detected in `buildChain`. Additional differences:

- **Base image**: uses `vm_image_url` (pre-baked VM qcow2) when available, falls back to a stock Incus VM image otherwise
- **Disk expansion**: runs `growpart` + `resize2fs`/`xfs_growfs` before package install (both for pre-baked images that ship at 10G and the final build which defaults to 100G)
- **Security config**: container-specific security settings (raw.idmap, nesting, setxattr interception) are skipped — VMs have their own kernel and don't need them
- **No restart**: VMs don't need the container restart that applies security config changes
- **Tool downloads**: large file pushes over vsock are slow, so `YamlToolSetup` uses a mount-and-copy strategy — the extracted archive is attached as a disk device and copied locally inside the VM
- **KVM passthrough**: when `type: kvm`, `/dev/kvm` is passed through to the VM for nested virtualization

**`buildFromParent` (derived image):**
1. Copy parent image, start, wait for network
2. Install image-defined packages via dnf (deduplicated — see below)
3. Install image-defined tools (with transitive `requires` resolution)
4. Clean caches
5. Tag metadata, stop

**Package deduplication**: Before installing packages, the build walks the parent chain and collects all packages from ancestor images and their tools. These are subtracted from the current image's package list so derived images only install what's new. The build logs both the count being installed and the count already present in ancestors.

**DNF cache sharing**: During builds, a persistent cache is mounted into the container at `/var/cache/libdnf5` so downloaded RPMs and metadata are reused across builds. On Linux, the cache is a host-side directory (`~/.cache/incus-spawn/dnf`) attached via a disk device with UID shifting. On macOS, a custom Incus storage volume (`dnf-cache`) is used instead, since the VM boundary prevents direct host-path read-write mounts. All dnf commands use `--setopt=keepcache=true` so downloaded RPMs persist. Repository metadata uses `--setopt=metadata_expire=3600` (1 hour) so repeated builds within that window skip metadata downloads. The cache device is unmounted before the final cleanup step so the image stays small. `isx clean cache` wipes the cache on both platforms — the host directory on Linux and the storage volume on macOS (via `IncusClient.deleteStorageVolume`). The volume is automatically recreated by the next build.

**DNF failure recovery**: All DNF install/upgrade commands are wrapped in `runDnf()`, which retries once on any failure: it runs `dnf clean metadata` to clear potentially stale repo data, then retries with `--refresh` to force fresh metadata from a (potentially different) mirror. This handles transient mirror issues like packages appearing in metadata before their signatures are available, without requiring manual intervention.

### Branching

Like `git branch`, branching creates an instant copy-on-write clone of any template image. Each branch has its own independent filesystem -- changes in one branch cannot affect the template image or any other branch. The CoW storage backend (btrfs/zfs/lvm) deduplicates unchanged data transparently at the block level, so branches are instant to create and only consume disk space for their own modifications.

**Static IP assignment**: Each branch receives a deterministic static IP on the bridge subnet at creation time. `StaticIpAllocator` scans all existing instances for claimed `ipv4.address` values on NIC devices and picks the lowest free host address (`.2`–`.254`). The IP is set on the Incus NIC device (so Incus is authoritative) and a `systemd-networkd` `.network` file is pushed into the stopped container before start, so the interface comes up statically at boot with no DHCP lease to expire. Templates do not have baked-in addresses — all CoW branches share the template filesystem, so a static address in the template would collide. The base image (from `Sanne/incus-spawn-images`) provides `systemd-networkd` and bakes in a connectivity watchdog (30s systemd timer) that detects IP loss after host sleep/wake and restarts `systemd-networkd` to recover; `isx` only supplies the per-branch address.

**VM deferred file pushes**: File push to a stopped VM is not possible (it requires the running `incus-agent` inside the VM). For VMs, `BranchCommand` and `ListCommand` skip pre-start file pushes (network config, SSH keys, terminfo) and instead call `InstanceLifecycle.pushDeferredVmFiles()` after starting the VM and waiting for the agent to become ready. The network config (IP and gateway) is read from Incus metadata at push time.

The TUI branch modal supports:
- Custom name
- GUI and audio passthrough (Wayland + PipeWire + GPU)
- Network mode selection (full internet / proxy-only / airgapped) via three-state radio
- Inbox mount (read-only host directory for sharing files into the container)
- VM resource limits (CPU, memory, disk)

### Resource Limits (Adaptive)

Detected at branch time from host resources:

- **CPU**: `available_cores - 2` (host keeps 2 cores, minimum 1)
- **Memory**: 60% of total RAM
- **Disk**: 20GB root disk

Overridable via TUI branch modal (for VMs, all three fields are shown).

### Container Configuration

**Capabilities**: `lxc.cap.drop =` (don't drop any — the container is the security boundary).

**Sysctl relaxation** (`/etc/sysctl.d/99-dev-container.conf`):
- `net.ipv4.ping_group_range = 0 2147483647` — unprivileged ping
- `kernel.dmesg_restrict = 0` — read kernel logs
- `kernel.perf_event_paranoid = 1` — perf profiling
- `kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 0` — strace/debuggers

**DNS**: systemd-resolved disabled, `/etc/resolv.conf` points at Incus bridge gateway (`incusbr0`), immutable via `chattr +i`.

**Terminal title**: The host terminal title is set to `isx:<containername>` during `isx shell` sessions (via OSC escape sequences) and restored on exit. Inside containers, `PROMPT_COMMAND` in `.bashrc` overrides Fedora's default title-setting to maintain the `isx:<hostname>` title. Claude Code's built-in terminal title override is also suppressed so the container name stays visible.

### SSH Key Management

incus-spawn manages a dedicated SSH key pair and per-instance SSH configuration so tools like JetBrains Gateway and `ssh` work without passphrase prompts or host key warnings:

```
~/.config/incus-spawn/ssh/
    id_ed25519          # managed private key (mode 600, no passphrase)
    id_ed25519.pub      # managed public key
    config              # per-instance Host blocks (managed by isx)
    known_hosts         # container host keys (isolated from ~/.ssh/known_hosts)
```

**Lifecycle:**

1. **`isx init`** generates the ed25519 key pair (via `ssh-keygen`) and prepends an `Include ~/.config/incus-spawn/ssh/config` directive to `~/.ssh/config` (idempotent, resolves symlinks for dotfile managers). The key pair is also created lazily at first branch for users upgrading from older versions.
2. **`isx branch`** (via `InstanceLifecycle.injectSshKeyIfAvailable`): injects both the managed public key and any personal `~/.ssh/*.pub` key into the container's `authorized_keys`. Then regenerates the container's SSH host keys (`ssh-keygen -A` + sshd restart) so CoW-branched instances get unique keys, harvests the new host public key into the managed `known_hosts`, and writes a `Host <instance-name>` block to the managed config with `HostName`, `User agentuser`, `IdentityFile`, `IdentitiesOnly yes`, `UserKnownHostsFile`, and `StrictHostKeyChecking yes`. After this, `ssh <instance-name>` just works.
3. **`isx destroy`** (and TUI delete): removes the Host block from the managed config and the host key entry from the managed known_hosts.

**Design decisions:**

- **Dual known_hosts**: the primary store is `~/.config/incus-spawn/ssh/known_hosts`, referenced via `UserKnownHostsFile` in the managed SSH config. Host keys are also written to `~/.ssh/known_hosts` because IntelliJ's built-in SSH client does not honor `UserKnownHostsFile` or `Include` directives — without the standard-file entry, IntelliJ Gateway prompts for host key confirmation on every connection. Entries in both files are cleaned up on instance destroy.
- **Host key regeneration**: CoW clones inherit the template's host keys, so all branches would share the same host key. `harvestHostKey` regenerates them before harvesting to give each instance a unique key.
- **Both keys injected**: the managed key (passphraseless) ensures tools always work, while the user's personal key is also injected so interactive SSH sessions can use their preferred key.
- **Atomic writes**: all config and known_hosts updates use temp-file-then-rename with restrictive permissions to avoid partial writes.
- **Non-fatal**: SSH setup failures never block init or branching — they warn and fall back to manual `ssh agentuser@<ip>`.

### Remote IDE Access

The built-in `idea-backend` tool installs the JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA remote development backend and registers the container for JetBrains Gateway discovery. It uses the `requires` field to automatically pull in the `sshd` tool, which configures an OpenSSH server with pubkey-only authentication. SSH key injection and host key validation are handled automatically by the SSH key management subsystem (see above), so Gateway connections work without any manual key setup. This enables IDE-based development inside containers: Gateway connects over SSH and runs the IntelliJ backend process inside the container, with the full project available.

### GUI and Audio Passthrough

Enables GUI applications and audio inside containers:
- GPU device passed through for hardware-accelerated rendering
- Host `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` bind-mounted, exposing the Wayland socket and PipeWire/PulseAudio socket
- Environment variables written to `/etc/profile.d/wayland.sh` (`WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, toolkit backends)

### Network Modes

Branches run in one of three network modes, selectable via CLI flags or the TUI branch modal:

**Full internet** (default): Container stays on the `incusbr0` bridge with NAT masquerading and a static IP assigned at branch time. Unrestricted outbound access to the internet. Traffic to intercepted domains (Anthropic, GitHub) is transparently authenticated by the host MITM proxy — credentials never enter the container in any form.

**Proxy only** (`--proxy-only`): Container stays on the bridge but iptables OUTPUT rules restrict all outbound traffic to the MITM proxy (port 443) and DNS. The container can only reach intercepted domains via the MITM proxy.

Container-side firewall rules:
```
iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -d <gateway> -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT     # MITM proxy
iptables -A OUTPUT -d <gateway> -p tcp --dport 18080 -j ACCEPT   # Health check
iptables -A OUTPUT -d <gateway> -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT      # DNS
iptables -P OUTPUT DROP
```

**Airgapped** (`--airgap`): Network device detached or removed. Complete network isolation — no egress at all.

### Auth & Security: MITM TLS Proxy

**API keys and tokens never enter containers.** A host-side MITM TLS proxy (`isx proxy`) provides transparent authentication. Placeholder values satisfy tools' local auth checks (e.g. `GH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), but the proxy replaces them with real credentials before requests reach upstream servers.

**How it works:**

1. The proxy configures bridge-level DNS overrides (via `raw.dnsmasq` on `incusbr0`) so all containers resolve intercepted domains to the gateway IP
2. Template images include a custom CA certificate (generated during `isx init`) so containers trust the proxy's TLS certificates
3. The proxy listens on port 18443 on the gateway IP. An iptables PREROUTING redirect rule (installed by `isx init` via `firewall-cmd --permanent --direct`) transparently redirects traffic arriving on `incusbr0` destined for port 443 to port 18443, avoiding conflicts with the Incus daemon on port 443. The proxy terminates TLS using per-domain certificates signed by the custom CA
4. Based on the target domain, the proxy injects authentication headers:
   - `api.anthropic.com` — `x-api-key: <anthropic-api-key>` (direct API key mode), `Authorization: Bearer <oauth-token>` (OAuth mode, for Claude Pro/Max subscriptions), or Vertex AI passthrough/translation with GCP Bearer token (Vertex mode, see below)
   - `github.com` (git HTTP) — `Authorization: Basic <base64(x-access-token:token)>`
   - Other GitHub domains (API, CDN) — `Authorization: Bearer <github-token>`
   - Container registry and Maven domains — relayed transparently with caching (no auth injection)
5. The proxy re-encrypts and forwards to the real upstream over TLS

**Vertex AI support:** When the host is configured for Vertex AI (`useVertex=true` in config), containers run Claude Code in **Vertex mode** with `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_VERTEX_AUTH=1`, and `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL=https://api.anthropic.com/v1`. This causes the Vertex SDK inside the container to send already-formatted Vertex requests (`/v1/projects/.../models/...:streamRawPredict`) to `api.anthropic.com`, which resolves to the proxy via dnsmasq. The proxy then forwards to the real Vertex endpoint with GCP credentials. No GCP credentials enter the container.

Running containers in Vertex mode (rather than standard mode) is required because Claude Code's model list depends on the provider: standard mode ("firstParty") shows a hardcoded subset that may omit newer models, while Vertex mode shows the full model catalogue. Using Vertex mode in the container ensures the `/model` picker matches what's available on the host.

**Three-way routing for Anthropic traffic:**

The proxy routes requests to `api.anthropic.com` through one of three paths based on the URL:

1. **Vertex passthrough** (`/v1/projects/...`): Requests already in Vertex format (from the container's Vertex SDK). The proxy strips `@date` model version suffixes from the URL (the global endpoint rejects them), removes the `anthropic-beta` header, injects a GCP Bearer token, and forwards to the real Vertex endpoint. The body is passed through unmodified — the Vertex SDK already formats it correctly.

2. **Standard-to-Vertex translation** (`/v1/messages`): Requests in standard Anthropic API format. The proxy buffers the body and translates to Vertex `rawPredict` format (see translation details below). This path is used if a container happens to send standard-format requests (e.g. from curl).

3. **Direct forwarding** (all other paths): Non-messages endpoints (settings, bootstrap, feature flags, MCP registry) are forwarded to the real `api.anthropic.com` with credential injection. These endpoints don't exist on the Vertex API.

**Standard-to-Vertex translation details** (path 2):

- URL: `/v1/messages` → `/v1/projects/{projectId}/locations/{region}/publishers/anthropic/models/{model}:rawPredict` (or `:streamRawPredict` when `stream=true`)
- Auth: replaces `x-api-key` with `Authorization: Bearer <gcp-token>` (obtained via `gcloud auth print-access-token`, cached ~50 minutes)
- Body: extracts `model` field and moves it into the URL path, stripping date suffixes (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6-20251001` → `claude-sonnet-4-6`)
- Body: adds `"anthropic_version": "vertex-2023-10-16"` (required by Vertex rawPredict)
- Body: strips all top-level fields not in the Vertex allowlist (beta features like `context_management` cause "Extra inputs" rejections)
- Body: recursively strips `scope` from nested `cache_control` objects (beta feature unsupported by Vertex)
- Header: removes `anthropic-beta` (Vertex rejects beta feature flags; features are enabled via `anthropic_version`)
- Host: rewrites to the Vertex endpoint hostname for the configured region

The body translation uses an allowlist approach: only known-good fields (`messages`, `system`, `max_tokens`, `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `stop_sequences`, `stream`, `metadata`, `tools`, `tool_choice`, `thinking`, `output_config`, `anthropic_version`) are kept. Everything else is dropped. This is more robust than blocklisting individual beta fields, since new Claude Code beta features are automatically stripped without proxy changes.

**Vertex AI protocol details** (learned from testing):

- **Hostname resolution by region**: The standard pattern is `{region}-aiplatform.googleapis.com` (e.g. `us-east5-aiplatform.googleapis.com`), but some meta-regions use special hostnames: `global` → `aiplatform.googleapis.com`, `us` → `aiplatform.us.rep.googleapis.com`, `eu` → `aiplatform.eu.rep.googleapis.com`
- **Model naming**: The Vertex SDK uses `@` for model version suffixes in URL paths (e.g. `claude-haiku-4-5@20251001`), while the standard API uses `-` (e.g. `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`). The global Vertex endpoint only accepts short model aliases without any version suffix — both `@20251001` and `-20251001` forms are rejected. The proxy strips both forms.
- **Beta features**: The `anthropic-beta` header is rejected by Vertex rawPredict with "Unexpected value(s) for anthropic-beta header". This includes common beta flags like `claude-code-20250219`, `interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14`, `web-search-2025-03-05`, and `prompt-caching-scope-2026-01-05`. Features like extended thinking work without any beta flags on Vertex — they're enabled via `anthropic_version`. The Vertex SDK moves `anthropic-beta` header values into the body as an `anthropic_beta` array, but even that is rejected ("invalid beta flag"). The proxy strips the header entirely without adding it to the body.
- **Auth skipping**: `CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_VERTEX_AUTH=1` causes the Vertex SDK to skip GCP authentication and return stub credentials that produce empty auth headers. The proxy then replaces these with real GCP tokens.
- **Base URL override**: `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL` redirects all Vertex SDK requests to a custom endpoint. Setting it to `https://api.anthropic.com/v1` causes the container's Vertex SDK to send requests to `api.anthropic.com`, which resolves to the proxy via dnsmasq.
- **Response format**: Vertex `rawPredict` returns standard Anthropic response format — no response translation is needed.

**Pi coding agent support:** Pi is a provider-agnostic coding agent that always communicates via the standard Anthropic API (`/v1/messages`). Unlike Claude Code, Pi does not have a Vertex mode — it always sends standard API requests with an `x-api-key` header. The proxy handles both direct key injection and standard-to-Vertex translation transparently. No Vertex-specific environment variables are needed inside the container; `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-placeholder` is the only auth configuration (declared via `PiSetup.envEntries()`).

**Intercepted domains:** `api.anthropic.com`, `github.com`, `api.github.com`, `raw.githubusercontent.com`, `objects.githubusercontent.com`, `codeload.github.com`, `uploads.github.com`, `bob.ibm.com` (and all subdomains), `registry-1.docker.io`, `auth.docker.io`, `ghcr.io`, `quay.io`, `repo.maven.apache.org`, `repo1.maven.org`, `plugins.gradle.org`

**HTTPS only:** The proxy intercepts HTTPS traffic, so Git operations must use HTTPS URLs (not SSH). `gh` defaults to HTTPS automatically; for `git clone`, use `https://github.com/...` instead of `git@github.com:...`.

All other domains (package mirrors, PyPI, etc.) route normally via Incus bridge NAT and are unaffected by the proxy.

**Credential validation**: Building a template image that includes `claude`, `pi`, or `gh` tools requires the corresponding credentials to be configured on the host. Both the CLI and TUI check this before starting a build and abort with a clear error if credentials are missing.

**Version drift detection**: The proxy health check (run before builds, branches, and shell access) compares the running proxy's version against the CLI version. If they differ: when no containers are running, the proxy is automatically restarted; when containers are running, a warning is shown with instructions to restart manually. This prevents subtle failures from CA certificate or protocol mismatches.

**CA certificate mismatch**: At branch time, `BranchCommand` compares the template's `ca-fingerprint` metadata against the current CA certificate. If they differ (e.g. after `isx init` regenerated the CA), a warning is shown suggesting to rebuild the template. This prevents TLS failures in branches where the container's trusted CA doesn't match the proxy's signing CA.

**Leaf certificate persistence (clock-skew safety)**: Per-domain leaf certs are not minted fresh on every proxy start. `CertStore` persists them under `~/.config/incus-spawn/certs/` (keyed by domain — `<domain>.crt`/`.key`, wildcards as `_wildcard.<domain>`) and reuses them across restarts, re-minting only when a cert is missing, was signed by a rotated CA, or is within 30 days of expiry.

This fixes an intermittent "certificate is not yet valid" failure. A cert's `notBefore` is stamped from the **host** clock at mint time, but it is validated against the **container** clock. These are independent clocks: on macOS the proxy runs on the Mac host (launchd, `KeepAlive=true`) while containers run inside an Incus VM whose clock lags after the Mac sleeps — `--timesync` only re-seeds at boot, not on resume. `KeepAlive` relaunches the proxy whenever it exits (including right after wake, when the Mac clock has already jumped forward to real time); re-minting at that moment produced a `notBefore` in the lagging container's future, failing validation with "certificate is not yet valid". No clock ever runs backward — both are monotonic — but the gap between the mint clock (host, ahead) and the validating clock (container, behind) can exceed a day. Reusing a persisted leaf keeps its original `notBefore` (stamped while the clocks were in sync), so the container's lagging-but-monotonic clock always accepts it. `CertificateAuthority.BACKDATE_MS` (2 days) backdates `notBefore` as a margin for the rare remaining fresh-mint moments (first install, CA rotation, near-expiry renewal). The underlying clock drift is now corrected by `chronyd` running inside the VM appliance — it steps the guest clock to NTP time within seconds of network recovery after wake (see `appliance/DESIGN.md`, Clock Synchronization). Cert persistence and backdating remain as defense-in-depth for the brief window before chrony syncs.

Certs are keyed by domain, never by container: a leaf is a function of `(domain, CA)` and is identical for every container that intercepts that domain. Planned per-container interception (a different intercepted-domain set per container) is a routing/DNS concern — it decides which domains reach the proxy for a given container — and does not change cert identity, so the store stays domain-keyed. The remaining work for that feature is to resolve certs per-SNI on demand against this same on-disk store rather than building a single JKS at start; the storage format does not change.

**Vertex AI token refresh**: Vertex AI requests that receive a 401 response are retried once with a fresh GCP access token (the cached token is invalidated). This handles token expiry during long-running sessions without user intervention.

**Buffered I/O**: The proxy uses 64KB `BufferedInputStream`/`BufferedOutputStream` on both client and upstream connections for throughput. SSE and chunked streaming responses are flushed after each line/chunk to avoid buffering delays.

**OAuth token support:** Users with a Claude Pro/Max subscription (no API key) can authenticate via `claude setup-token`, which generates a long-lived (~1 year) OAuth token. The proxy injects `Authorization: Bearer <token>` into requests to `api.anthropic.com` and strips the container's placeholder `x-api-key` header. Containers are configured identically to direct API key mode (with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-placeholder`). Unlike Vertex AI tokens, OAuth tokens cannot be refreshed automatically — when a 401 is received, the proxy logs an actionable error directing the user to re-run `isx init`.

**Configuration**: `~/.config/incus-spawn/config.yaml` (owner-only permissions, `chmod 600`). CA key and certificate at `~/.config/incus-spawn/ca.key` and `~/.config/incus-spawn/ca.crt`. Vertex AI users must have `gcloud` installed on the host and `gcloud auth application-default login` completed.

### Host Resources

Template images can declare host files and directories to share with containers via the `host-resources` YAML key. Three modes control how the resource is made available:

**Readonly** (default): a read-only Incus disk device bind mount. The container can read the host file/directory but cannot modify it. Simple and safe for config files like `~/.gitconfig`.

**Overlay**: the host directory is attached as a read-only lower layer, with an ephemeral writable upper layer inside the container, combined via Linux overlayfs. The container sees a normal read-write directory, but writes go to the container-local upper layer — the host is fully protected. This is the right mode for caches (Maven, OCI) where tools expect to write but you don't need writes to persist back to the host.

**Copy**: the file or directory is copied into the container at build time and becomes part of the template. Supports local paths and URLs. No runtime dependency on the host.

#### Overlay internals

For a host-resource with `mode: overlay` targeting `/home/agentuser/.m2/repository`:

1. **Build time**: the host directory is attached as a read-only Incus disk device at `/var/lib/incus-spawn/overlays/home/agentuser/.m2/repository/lower`. The container creates `upper` and `work` siblings, then runs `mount -t overlay` to present the merged view at the target path. A systemd service (`incus-spawn-overlays.service`) is installed and enabled to re-apply the overlay mount on boot.

2. **After build**: the overlay is unmounted and the disk device is removed from the stopped template. The upper and work directories remain as container-local files. The full host-resource configuration is stored as JSON in `user.incus-spawn.host-resources` metadata.

3. **At branch time**: `BranchCommand` reads the stored metadata and re-attaches the disk device to the stopped instance before starting it. On boot, the systemd service re-mounts the overlay. The upper layer — now containing build artifacts — was copied via CoW when the instance was branched, so each instance has its own independent writable layer.

4. **On reboot**: the systemd service fires on every boot and re-mounts overlays. This works even if the container is started directly via `incus start` rather than through `isx`.

The overlay directory structure mirrors the container path directly under `/var/lib/incus-spawn/overlays/`, so the layout is self-documenting:

```
/var/lib/incus-spawn/overlays/home/agentuser/.m2/repository/
  ├── lower/    ← read-only disk device mount (host directory)
  ├── upper/    ← container-local writable layer (follows CoW branching)
  └── work/     ← overlayfs internal bookkeeping
```

Incus disk device names are derived from the container path for readability (e.g. `hr-home-agentuser--m2-repository`). They are removed from stopped templates to avoid host-path dependencies and re-attached at branch time.

#### VM behavior

VMs mount Incus disk devices asynchronously via virtiofs (managed by the `incus-agent`). For overlay mode, `applyOverlay` polls `mountpoint -q` for up to 15 seconds before running the overlay mount, since the lower directory may not be populated yet when the mount command runs. If the device doesn't appear in time, the overlay is skipped with a warning.

File-level host resources (individual files rather than directories) automatically fall back to `copy` mode on VMs, since Incus disk devices only support directory mounts for virtual machines. The fallback is logged: "VM: falling back to copy mode for file ...".

#### Missing sources

If a host path doesn't exist at build or branch time, the entry is skipped with a warning. The build/branch proceeds without it.

#### Inheritance

Host resources compose additively across the parent chain, with override-by-container-path. If a parent declares `~/.gitconfig` as `readonly` and a child declares `~/.gitconfig` as `copy`, the child's mode wins. This follows the same last-write-wins pattern as package deduplication.

### Metadata Tracking

Containers tagged via Incus `user.*` config keys:

```
user.incus-spawn.type=base
user.incus-spawn.profile=tpl-java
user.incus-spawn.parent=tpl-dev
user.incus-spawn.created=2026-04-07
user.incus-spawn.build-version=0.1.11        # isx version that built the template
user.incus-spawn.build-sha=c434ef9           # git commit SHA of isx at build time
user.incus-spawn.definition-sha=a1b2c3d4     # fingerprint of image def + tool defs
user.incus-spawn.ca-fingerprint=AB:CD:EF:... # CA certificate fingerprint
user.incus-spawn.build-source={...}          # (JSON, full image + tool defs for out-of-scope visibility)
user.incus-spawn.network-mode=PROXY_ONLY     # (proxy-only branches only)
user.incus-spawn.proxy-gateway=10.166.11.1   # (proxy-only branches only)
user.incus-spawn.static-ip=10.166.11.2       # (branches only, assigned at creation)
user.incus-spawn.host-resources=[...]        # (JSON, when host-resources declared)
```

**Staleness detection**: The TUI uses `build-version` and `definition-sha` to display staleness indicators next to template names:
- `!` — template was built with a different isx version than the running CLI
- `△` — the image definition or its tool definitions have changed since the last build (fingerprint mismatch)
- `↑` — a parent template was rebuilt more recently than this template

**Build source storage**: `build-source` stores the full image definition hierarchy and tool definitions as JSON. This allows templates built from definitions that are no longer in scope (e.g. project-local definitions from a different working directory) to still be displayed and rebuilt in the TUI.

### Storage and COW

Copy-on-write storage is essential for efficient branching. `isx init` automatically creates a btrfs storage pool (`cow`) if no CoW-capable pool exists. All instance creation (`launch` and `copy`) auto-detects the best CoW pool and uses it via `--storage`, regardless of what the default Incus profile points to.

Supported CoW drivers: **btrfs**, **zfs**, **lvm**. If btrfs pool creation fails during init (e.g. unsupported filesystem), the user is warned and can continue with the `dir` driver, but clones will be full copies.

### Repo Cloning and Reference Optimization

Repos declared in an image definition are cloned into the container during build as `agentuser`. Clones use `--single-branch` to fetch only the target branch (or the default branch when none is specified), avoiding the download of hundreds of release/PR branches and thousands of tags that are present on large upstream repos but rarely needed in a dev container. After cloning, `git remote set-branches origin '*'` immediately widens the fetch refspec — this is a pure metadata write with no network traffic — so the clone is indistinguishable from a regular one. Other branches populate lazily on first `git fetch` or `git checkout`.

**Reference clone optimization**: When `host-paths` or `repo-paths` is configured in `~/.config/incus-spawn/config.yaml`, the build checks whether a matching host-side checkout exists before cloning. The lookup first checks direct children of each configured base directory, then recursively scans subdirectories up to 4 levels deep (skipping known non-project directories like `.git`, `node_modules`, `target`, `build`, `vendor`, etc.) to handle repos organized in nested folder structures (e.g. `~/Code/java/repo-a`). When a repo subdirectory exists in more than one location, the build fails with an error instructing the user to add an explicit `repo-paths` entry to disambiguate. Matching uses URL normalization (strips scheme, `user@`, SSH colon separator, trailing `.git`, `www.`, then lowercases) and checks **all** git remotes, not just `origin` — this handles the common case where the user's fork is `origin` and the canonical upstream is `upstream`. If a match is found, the host directory is temporarily mounted into the container as a read-only Incus disk device (`readonly=true shift=true`) at a fixed path under `/var/lib/incus-spawn/repo-ref/` and passed to `git clone --single-branch --reference <path> --dissociate`. Git satisfies most objects from the local copy (typically 70–90% for large repos with a reasonably current checkout), reducing network traffic from hundreds of megabytes to a small delta of commits added since the last `git fetch`. The `--dissociate` flag makes the resulting clone fully self-contained so the device can be immediately removed. If the reference mount or clone fails for any reason the build falls back transparently to a plain clone.

**TUI visibility**: The F3 template detail view shows the host repo link status for each declared repo — the resolved host path when matched, or "No matching host checkout found" when not. This lets users verify their `host-paths`/`repo-paths` configuration without running a build.

### Git Remote Helper

Containers cloned via `isx branch` are isolated development environments, but developers need a way to get their changes back to the host. Rather than inventing a custom sync mechanism, incus-spawn integrates with git's native remote helper protocol so standard `git fetch`/`git push`/`git pull` work between host repos and container repos.

**Architecture: bash shim + Java command**

The git remote helper is split into two processes:

1. **`git-remote-isx`** (bash script): installed alongside `isx` in `$PATH`. Git discovers it automatically when a remote URL uses the `isx://` scheme. The script handles the text-based git remote helper protocol (advertising the `connect` capability), then `exec`s `isx git-remote-helper` to handle the actual transport.

2. **`isx git-remote-helper`** (Java/picocli command): validates the instance is running, validates the requested service against an allowlist, and uses `IncusClient.execBidirectional` to run `<service> '<path>'` inside the container with stdin/stdout forwarded over WebSocket. The git pack protocol flows directly between the host git process and the container git process.

The bash `exec` replaces the shell process with the Java process before any data flows through stdin. This is critical: Java's `BufferedInputStream` would consume bytes from the stdin pipe that are meant for the git pack protocol, corrupting the stream. By having bash handle only the text protocol exchange (a few short lines) and then `exec`-replacing itself, the Java process inherits the raw file descriptors with no buffered-ahead data.

Stderr is captured in a virtual thread so the command can detect "not a git repository" errors and print hints listing known repos from the image definition chain.

**URL scheme**

`isx://<instance-name>/<path-to-repo>` — for example, `isx://fix-auth/home/agentuser/quarkus` or `isx://fix-auth/~/quarkus` (tilde expands to `/home/agentuser`).

**Auto-remote management**

When the user configures `host-paths` (and optionally `repo-paths`) in `config.yaml`, incus-spawn automatically adds and removes git remotes in host repositories:

- **On `isx branch`**: for each repo declared in the image definition chain, resolve the corresponding host repo via `repo-paths` (exact match) or `host-paths` (base directories scanned recursively up to 4 levels deep). Direct-child matches take priority; recursive scanning only fires when no direct match exists. When the same repo name appears in more than one location, the operation fails with an error instructing the user to add an explicit `repo-paths` entry. Verify that any of the host repo's remotes (not just `origin`) match the container repo's URL (protocol-lenient comparison). If a match is found, add a remote named after the instance.
- **On `isx destroy`**: scan candidate host repos for any remote with a URL matching `isx://<instance-name>/` and remove it.

The removal is stateless — rather than tracking which remotes were added, we scan for `isx://` URLs matching the instance name. This avoids a class of bugs where state gets out of sync (e.g., the user manually removes a remote, or the add failed silently).

**Protocol-lenient URL matching**

Host repos may use SSH URLs (`git@github.com:org/repo.git`) while container repos use HTTPS (`https://github.com/org/repo.git`). The URL matcher normalizes both formats by stripping the scheme, `user@` prefix, SSH `:` separator, trailing `.git`, `www.` prefix, and lowercasing. The result is a canonical form like `github.com/org/repo` that matches regardless of protocol.

## Testing

**Unit tests** (`mvn test`, no Incus needed):
- `ToolDefTest` — YAML tool parsing, fingerprinting, composite fingerprints with transitive dependencies
- `ToolDefLoaderTest` — resolution order (builtins, user overrides, unknown tools)
- `YamlToolSetupTest` — execution order with mocked Container
- `ImageDefTest` — image definition loading, parent chain, descriptions, fingerprinting
- `BuildCommandTest` — `.claude.json` trust configuration, skill deduplication across inheritance chains, shell quoting, GitHub URL parsing
- `GitRemoteUtilsTest` — URL normalization (SSH/HTTPS/case), protocol-lenient matching, reference device naming (hash-based, truncation, collision resistance), host repo matching across multiple remotes
- `IncusApiTest` — REST API request/response parsing, exec body format, default exec environment, LOGIN_PATH_PREFIX

**Live tests** (`sg incus-admin -c "mvn test"`, requires Incus daemon + cached test image):
- `IncusApiLiveTest` — REST protocol against real Incus: all endpoints, exec capture/stream, device ops, copy, launch, logs
- `IncusClientSmokeTest` — high-level API: pollUntilReady, shellExec, execBidirectional, execPty, runAsUser, copy, filePush, filePushRecursive (directory placement + permission preservation), login PATH
- `BuildPipelineSmokeTest` — full buildFromScratch + buildFromParent operation sequence

**Integration tests** (`mvn verify -DskipITs=false`, requires Incus):
- `TemplateBuildIT` — builds actual images, verifies metadata and agentuser

## Technical Tradeoffs

### System containers vs application containers
System containers run a full init system and present as a complete machine. This means higher base image size (~200MB vs ~5MB Alpine) and longer first-build time (system upgrade, user creation, tool installation). However, clones are instant and near-zero cost with CoW storage, which is the common operation — you build once, branch many times.

### No capability dropping (`lxc.cap.drop =`)
Standard Incus containers drop many Linux capabilities for defense-in-depth. We don't, because the container *is* the security boundary and developers expect `ping`, `strace`, `perf`, raw sockets, and `dmesg` to work. The risk is that a container escape exploit has more host capabilities to abuse. For untrusted code where this matters, use `--vm` for KVM isolation with a separate kernel.

### YAML tools vs a full plugin system (Packer, Ansible, etc.)
We evaluated Packer (null builder + shell provisioner) and Ansible but rejected both. Packer's null builder is just indirection over what Java already does, and Ansible adds a Python dependency and playbook complexity for what amounts to "install some packages and run some scripts." YAML tool definitions give 90% of the flexibility with zero dependencies. Java `ToolSetup` implementations remain available as an escape hatch for tools that need programmatic logic (reading host config, conditional branching).

### Hardcoded built-in tool list vs classpath scanning
Built-in YAML tools are loaded from a hardcoded list of filenames rather than scanning the classpath. This is a deliberate choice: Quarkus native image compilation makes classpath directory listing unreliable, and the list only changes when a developer adds a built-in tool (at which point they also update the loader). User-defined tools in `.incus-spawn/tools/` are discovered via filesystem scanning.

### DNS: static resolv.conf + bridge dnsmasq
systemd-resolved (127.0.0.53) doesn't work reliably inside Incus containers because it expects to manage the network configuration. We disable it, point `/etc/resolv.conf` directly at the Incus bridge gateway (which runs dnsmasq), and make the file immutable with `chattr +i`. This is less flexible than systemd-resolved (no per-link DNS, no DNSSEC validation) but works reliably across container restarts and network changes. Domain interception for the MITM proxy is configured at the bridge level via `raw.dnsmasq` (dnsmasq `address=` directives), not via per-container `/etc/hosts`. This avoids a class of bugs where Incus overwrites `/etc/hosts` on container start.

### Credential isolation via MITM TLS proxy
A TLS-terminating MITM proxy intercepts HTTPS connections to specific domains (Anthropic API, GitHub, IBM Bob), injects authentication headers server-side, and forwards to the real upstream. Containers resolve these domains to the gateway IP via bridge-level dnsmasq overrides (configured when `isx proxy` starts) and trust the proxy's certificates via a custom CA installed in the template image. This approach was chosen over simpler alternatives (reverse proxy with `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, credential helpers, shell wrappers) because those approaches still expose credentials to code running inside the container — either as environment variables, in process memory via `curl` calls, or through accessible endpoints. The MITM proxy provides complete isolation: there is no API, endpoint, environment variable, or file that container code can access to obtain credentials.

### Vertex AI: container in Vertex mode vs standard mode
We initially ran containers in standard (non-Vertex) mode with proxy-side API translation — the container sent `/v1/messages` and the proxy rewrote to Vertex `rawPredict`. This had a critical flaw: Claude Code's model list is provider-dependent. In standard "firstParty" mode the model picker is a hardcoded subset that omits newer models (e.g. Opus 4.6 was missing). In Vertex mode the full catalogue is shown.

The solution: containers now run in Vertex mode with `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_VERTEX_AUTH=1` (skips GCP auth — the SDK uses stub credentials that produce empty auth headers), and `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL=https://api.anthropic.com/v1` (redirects the Vertex SDK to the proxy). The Vertex SDK formats requests in Vertex URL format (`/v1/projects/.../models/...:streamRawPredict`), sends them to the proxy, and the proxy injects real GCP credentials before forwarding to the actual Vertex endpoint. The proxy also retains the standard-to-Vertex translation path for `/v1/messages` requests — this is the primary path for tools like Pi that use the standard Anthropic API format, and also serves manual `curl` calls inside the container.

**Fragility and mitigation:** The standard-to-Vertex translation path uses an allowlist (`VERTEX_ALLOWED_FIELDS` in `MitmProxy.java`) that may drift as Anthropic adds new standard fields. However, the primary traffic flow (Vertex passthrough) doesn't use the allowlist — the Vertex SDK already formats the body correctly. The allowlist only affects the fallback translation path. The `anthropic_version: "vertex-2023-10-16"` value is hardcoded in the translation path — this matches the Anthropic Vertex SDK and has been stable since Vertex support launched. The Vertex passthrough path doesn't set this value; the SDK does it itself.

### Git remote helper: bash + Java split
The git remote helper is split into a bash shim and a Java command rather than implementing the full protocol in Java. The reason is stdin buffering: Java's `BufferedInputStream` (used by `System.in` and `ProcessBuilder`) reads ahead into an internal buffer. In the git remote helper protocol, the initial text exchange ("capabilities", "connect git-upload-pack") is followed by a binary pack protocol stream on the same stdin pipe. If Java reads even one byte too many during the text phase, the binary stream is corrupted. The bash shim handles only the text protocol (a few short lines via `read`), then `exec`-replaces itself with the Java process. The Java process inherits raw file descriptors with no buffered-ahead data and can safely use `execBidirectional` (WebSocket-based stdin/stdout forwarding) to pipe the git pack protocol to the container.

The alternative — implementing the full protocol in Java with careful single-byte reads — is fragile and would need to be re-validated with every JDK update that touches `System.in` buffering behaviour.

### Auto-remote: stateless cleanup vs state tracking
When an instance is destroyed, its git remotes need to be removed from host repos. Two approaches: (1) track which remotes were added in metadata and remove exactly those, or (2) scan host repos for `isx://` URLs matching the instance name. We chose stateless scanning because it's simpler and eliminates a class of state-sync bugs (user manually removes a remote, add failed silently, metadata gets corrupted). The cost is scanning a few git repos on every destroy, which takes milliseconds.

### Single-branch clone with lazy refspec restoration
Template builds clone repos with `--single-branch` to avoid fetching objects for all remote branches and tags — on a large project like Quarkus this is the difference between ~3 MiB and ~100 MiB of network traffic even with a current host reference. The fetch refspec is immediately widened with `git remote set-branches origin '*'`, which costs nothing (no network, no object transfer) and makes the clone behave like a regular one. Users never need to know they received a single-branch clone; `git fetch`, `git branch -r`, and `git checkout other-branch` all work as expected — other branches just populate on first access.

The alternative — a full clone — would download objects for hundreds of branches and thousands of tags that most container workflows never touch. Post-hoc pruning is not straightforward because git doesn't garbage-collect fetched objects unless explicitly told to. The single-branch + refspec-restore approach gets the performance benefit without any user-visible limitation.

### Auto-remote: opt-in via configuration
Auto-remote management requires explicit `host-paths` or `repo-paths` configuration — we don't scan `~` or `/` to auto-discover repos. Within configured `host-paths`, subdirectories are scanned recursively up to 4 levels deep, skipping known non-project directories (`.git`, `node_modules`, `target`, `build`, `vendor`, etc.). This handles the common case where repos are organized in category subfolders (e.g. `~/Code/java/`, `~/Code/go/`). Direct-child matches take priority over nested matches. If the same repo name appears in multiple locations, the operation fails with an error instructing the user to add an explicit `repo-paths` entry to disambiguate.

### Fedora-specific
The base image and package management are Fedora-specific (`dnf`, `images:fedora/44`). This is intentional — supporting multiple distros adds complexity for a tool primarily targeting developer workstations where Fedora is a common choice. The YAML tool system is distro-agnostic in principle (tools can use any shell commands), but the built-in base image setup assumes Fedora.

### Incus Daemon Connection

The CLI communicates with the Incus daemon via its REST API. The transport depends on the platform:

**Linux** (direct): The Incus daemon exposes a Unix domain socket at `/run/incus/unix.socket`. The CLI speaks plain HTTP/1.1 over this socket — no TLS, no authentication (access is governed by Unix socket permissions and the `incus-admin` group). WebSocket-based exec sessions (for `isx shell`, file push, etc.) use the same socket.

**macOS** (via VM): Incus runs inside a VM managed by vfkit. The CLI connects via a **vsock tunnel** — a direct host↔VM communication channel that bypasses the IP network entirely:

```
UnixSocketTransport (plain HTTP/1.1)
  → ~/.local/state/incus-spawn/vm.incus.sock  (Unix socket on host)
    → vfkit virtio-vsock device (port 8443)
      → socat VSOCK-LISTEN:8443 inside VM
        → /run/incus/unix.socket (Incus daemon)
```

vfkit exposes the VM's vsock port 8443 as a Unix domain socket on the host. Inside the VM, socat bridges the vsock listener to the Incus daemon's local Unix socket. The result is that the macOS path reuses the same `UnixSocketTransport` as Linux — plain HTTP, no TLS, no certificates.

**Why vsock instead of HTTPS:** The original macOS transport used HTTPS over TCP to the VM's DHCP-assigned IP (192.168.64.0/24 subnet). This required client certificate generation, server certificate capture, hostname verification bypass (the self-signed cert doesn't include the DHCP IP), and IP rediscovery on VM restart. More critically, corporate VPN software (notably Cisco AnyConnect) installs a macOS socket filter that blocks non-Apple-signed binaries from TCP connections to the VM subnet — even when the VPN is disconnected. Since `isx` is an ad-hoc-signed GraalVM native binary, AnyConnect blocks it from reaching the VM over TCP. vsock bypasses this entirely because it operates outside the IP network stack (`AF_VSOCK`, not `AF_INET`), so socket filters that target TCP connections cannot intercept it. The MITM proxy is unaffected because its traffic flows in the opposite direction — containers inside the VM connect outward to the host, which arrives as inbound traffic to the proxy process, not as an outbound `connect()` from `isx`.

**No HTTPS fallback:** `IncusApi.tryConnect()` selects a transport in order: Linux Unix sockets → vsock Unix socket. The earlier HTTPS-over-TCP path (mutual TLS to the VM's DHCP IP) has been removed — it reintroduced exactly the problems vsock exists to avoid (macOS Local Network permission prompts and VPN socket-filter blocking, described above), and maintaining two transports made field issues hard to diagnose because it was unknowable which path a given user was actually on. (`HttpsTransport` still exists in the tree but is no longer wired into connection selection.)

### macOS vsock robustness

The vfkit vsock tunnel (`AF_VSOCK` across `host unix socket → vfkit → in-VM socat → Incus`) does **not reliably propagate connection close/EOF** — particularly after macOS sleep/resume, when in-flight streams are left half-open. That single fault surfaced in two directions and shaped several design choices:

- **Exec completion is derived from the operation, not the socket.** WebSocket exec (`isx shell`, package installs, git) originally read stdout/stderr until the server closed the fds. When close frames are dropped, `readPayload()` blocks forever. The fix (`IncusApi.execWebSocket`) unifies capture/stream/bidirectional exec and takes the operation `/wait` endpoint — the daemon's operation state, over a normal HTTP request — as the authoritative completion + exit-code signal, then drains and force-closes the data sockets. Completion no longer depends on close-frame delivery. Every exec fd is keepalive-pinged (each is a separate socat child that an inactivity reaper would otherwise collect on a quiet command), and the post-exit drain is **adaptive**: it waits a short minimum for bytes in flight, extends while output is still arriving (so trailing output isn't truncated), and closes shortly after it goes idle.

- **The forwarder leaks, so it needs a backstop and a recovery path.** The same close-propagation gap means the in-VM `socat` forwarder never reaps connections whose close didn't cross the boundary; they pile up as vfkit-held host fds and degrade every new connection (observed: hundreds of leaked streams, `list` latency from sub-second to ~30s). Mitigations: a `socat -T` **inactivity timeout** reaps orphaned children (sized above the 120s `/wait` long-poll, with keepalives so live connections are never reaped); a **keep-alive connection cache** (`ConnectionPool`/`KeepAliveConnection`, via `requestPooled`) reuses a warm connection for short request-path calls (`get`/`post`/`/wait`) instead of reconnecting each time, cutting the churn that feeds the leak (exec WebSocket fds are per-operation and not poolable); and a per-process connection gauge + high-water mark in `UnixSocketTransport` makes accumulation visible.

- **Diagnosis and no-reboot recovery.** `isx doctor` runs host/VM/tunnel checks and, for a forwarder leak, compares the host-side connection count against the in-VM socat child count to localize the layer (vfkit not reaping vs the forwarder lingering). Recovery is provided by a small **allowlisted in-VM control agent** (`isx-agent`) on its own vsock port — verbs `ping` / `socat-count` / `sshd-status` / `forwarder-restart` only, no arbitrary exec — reached over an independent channel so it works even when the Incus tunnel is wedged. `forwarder-restart` drops and relaunches the forwarder **without rebooting the VM or stopping containers**. See appliance/DESIGN.md for the in-VM side.

## VM Appliance

A minimal Alpine Linux VM image with Incus pre-installed, providing CI integration testing and macOS support. Uses BusyBox init (not systemd or OpenRC) for fastest possible boot. Custom kernel from kernel.org source (zero modules, no initrd) with musl libc for fast dynamic linking. The build produces a rootfs tarball (~30-40 MB) and kernel (~11 MB); a writable btrfs disk image is created on first boot. See [`appliance/DESIGN.md`](appliance/DESIGN.md) for full architecture details.

## Security Considerations

### Container vs VM Trade-off
- **Containers** (default): share host kernel. A kernel exploit could escape. Suitable for semi-trusted code (AI agents with scoped permissions, community bug reproducers).
- **VMs** (`--vm` flag): hardware-level isolation via KVM. Recommended for actively malicious code. Separate kernel eliminates kernel exploit as an escape vector. ~10% performance overhead.

### Credential Isolation

Real API keys and tokens never enter containers, regardless of network mode. Containers hold only placeholder values that satisfy tools' local auth checks; the proxy replaces them with real credentials before requests reach upstream servers.

| Credential | Container has | How it works |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Claude API key (direct mode) | Placeholder `sk-ant-placeholder` | Proxy replaces `x-api-key` header with real key |
| Claude OAuth token (Pro/Max) | Placeholder `sk-ant-placeholder` | Proxy strips `x-api-key` and injects `Authorization: Bearer <oauth-token>`. Container configuration is identical to direct API key mode |
| GCP credentials (Vertex mode) | **Nothing** | Container runs Claude Code in Vertex mode with `CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_VERTEX_AUTH=1`. Proxy injects GCP Bearer token from `gcloud` on the host. No GCP credentials, service accounts, or access tokens enter the container |
| Pi Anthropic key | Placeholder `sk-ant-placeholder` in `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Same as Claude direct/OAuth mode. Pi always uses standard API format; the proxy handles key injection, OAuth Bearer injection, or Vertex translation transparently |
| GitHub token | Placeholder `gho_placeholder` in `GH_TOKEN` | Proxy replaces `Authorization` header with real token for GitHub domains (Basic auth for `github.com` git HTTP, Bearer for API) |

The MITM TLS proxy provides credential isolation:
1. Bridge-level dnsmasq overrides (configured by `isx proxy`) route intercepted domains to the gateway IP
2. A custom CA certificate (installed in template images) lets containers trust the proxy's TLS certs
3. The proxy terminates TLS, replaces placeholder auth with real credentials, and forwards to real upstream over TLS
4. Placeholder values cannot authenticate against any service — they only bypass local tool checks
5. In proxy-only mode, iptables OUTPUT rules additionally block all egress except the proxy port (443) and DNS

### Filesystem Isolation
- Inbox mount is strictly read-only
- Host resources default to read-only; overlay mode provides an ephemeral writable layer but the host directory is never modified
- Clone filesystems are independent CoW copies — changes in one clone don't affect others or the template image
