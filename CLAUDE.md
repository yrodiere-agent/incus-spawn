# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

incus-spawn (`isx`) is a CLI tool for managing isolated Incus-based development environments. It creates full Linux system containers (not Docker-style app containers) with copy-on-write branching, a MITM TLS proxy for credential isolation, and an interactive TUI. See README.md for user-facing docs, DESIGN.md for architecture rationale, and [docs/CHARACTER.md](docs/CHARACTER.md) for the project's mission and design philosophy.

**Keep docs in sync**: When making architectural changes (new proxy capabilities, new tool types, new init steps, module structure changes, CI job changes, new intercepted domains, etc.), update both this file and DESIGN.md in the same PR. CLAUDE.md is the quick-reference for contributors; DESIGN.md is the full rationale. Both must stay current.

## Build and Test Commands

```shell
mvn package                    # Build both modules (CLI: cli/target/, proxy: proxy/target/)
mvn test                       # Unit tests only (no Incus required)
mvn verify -DskipITs=false     # Unit + integration tests (requires running Incus)
mvn test -Dtest=ToolDefTest    # Run a single test class
mvn test -Dtest=ToolDefTest#testAllFields  # Run a single test method

mvn package -Dnative -DskipTests           # GraalVM native binaries (isx + isx-proxy)

./install.sh                   # Build and install JVM version to ~/.local/bin/isx
./install.sh --native          # Build and install native binaries
```

## Tech Stack

- **Java 25**, **Quarkus 3.x** with aesh for CLI commands
- **Tamboui** for the interactive TUI (terminal UI framework)
- **Jackson YAML** for configuration/definition parsing
- **Quarkus CDI** for dependency injection (tool discovery, command wiring)

## Module Structure

Three Maven modules under a parent POM:

- **`common`** (`incus-spawn-common`): shared code — Incus client, proxy config, image/tool definitions, configuration loading. Not a Quarkus app; uses the Jandex Maven plugin to produce a `META-INF/jandex.idx` so Quarkus discovers its CDI beans and `@RegisterForReflection` annotations from dependent modules.
- **`cli`** (`incus-spawn`): the main CLI/TUI binary (`isx`). Depends on common. Native image: serial GC, `-Os` (size-optimized), `-H:-AllowVMInternalThreads`,
  and on x86_64 `-march=haswell` (arch-gated in `cli/pom.xml`, same as the proxy). It downloads tool tarballs and VM images over HTTPS, and the default
  `x86-64-v3` omits AES/CLMUL: 79 MB/s vs ~3100 MB/s for AES-256-GCM. Binary size is byte-identical and startup ~11% faster, so it costs nothing here.
- **`proxy`** (`incus-spawn-proxy`): the standalone MITM proxy binary (`isx-proxy`). Depends on common. Native image: G1 GC, `-O3` (throughput-optimized, enables ML-inferred PGO), and on x86_64 `-march=haswell`.
  The `-march` value is set by arch-gated Maven profiles in `proxy/pom.xml` (empty on aarch64, where an x86 `-march` would fail the build).
  GraalVM's default `-march=x86-64-v3` omits AES and CLMUL, so the image cannot use AES-NI/GHASH intrinsics and TLS falls back to software AES —
  measured 73 MB/s vs 960 MB/s serving a cached Maven artifact (~13x). `haswell` costs no hardware support: AES-NI predates the v3 baseline by three
  years. `skylake` (+ADX) measures indistinguishably, so its narrowing is not worth taking. Do not "upgrade" this to `x86-64-v4`: the numbered levels
  never include AES, so v4 measures identically to v3 while dropping non-AVX-512 hardware.
Both `cli` and `proxy` are independent Quarkus applications that produce separate native binaries. When `isx-proxy` is not installed, `isx proxy start` falls back to running the proxy inline within the CLI process.

## Architecture

### Entry Point and Command Structure

`IncusSpawn.java` is the aesh `@CommandDefinition` top command. With no subcommand, it launches the TUI (`ListCommand`). Each subcommand in `command/` is an aesh `@CommandDefinition` with Quarkus DI.

**Platform-specific command tree**: aesh bakes `groupCommands` into the annotation at compile time, so macOS-only commands can't exist on one platform without a second top command. `IncusSpawn` defines two variants — `IncusSpawnCommand` (macOS, includes the `vm` group) and `IncusSpawnLinuxCommand` (identical minus `vm`) — and picks one at runtime via `Platform.isMacOS()`. The result: on Linux `isx vm` is an unknown command and never appears in `isx --help` (Incus runs natively there, so there is no appliance VM to manage). `CompletionCommand.stripVmCommand()` keeps the generated shell completions in step by removing the `vm` command on Linux (leaving the unrelated `build --type vm` value untouched). When adding a *shared* command, add it to **both** command lists — `IncusSpawnCommandTreeTest` fails if they drift (the two lists must be identical except for `vm`). When adding another macOS-only command, add it to `IncusSpawnCommand` only and extend the completion strip.

### Init and Versioned Completion

`InitCommand` runs first-time setup (dependencies, Incus, firewall, CA, proxy service, etc.). On Linux it also installs a tightly-scoped NOPASSWD sudoers rule (`configureBtrfsUsageAccess` → `/etc/sudoers.d/incus-spawn-btrfs`) permitting only read-only `btrfs qgroup show`/`subvolume list` against the CoW pool mount, so the non-root TUI/build can read referenced sizes for per-template disk accounting (validated with `visudo -cf` before install). Commands that need a working environment call `InitCommand.requireInit()`, which auto-launches init if it hasn't completed. Completion is tracked by a sentinel file `~/.config/incus-spawn/.init-complete` containing `INIT_VERSION` — a version integer defined in `InitCommand`. Every init step is idempotent, so re-running is safe.

**When to bump `INIT_VERSION`**: increment it when adding a new infrastructure step to init that existing installations need (new dependency, firewall rule, systemd service, config field). A sentinel *older* than `INIT_VERSION` causes `hasBeenInitialized()` to return false, triggering a re-run on the next command. Do NOT bump it for changes that don't affect host configuration (new template features, TUI changes, proxy logic changes).

The comparison is `>=`, not equality: the sentinel is a monotonic floor, so a binary that finds a *newer* sentinel treats itself as initialized rather than concluding init never ran. This matters when two isx builds are installed at once (e.g. `/usr/bin/isx` and `~/.local/bin/isx`) — under equality the older one both hard-failed the proxy service and re-ran init to write the sentinel back down, ping-ponging with the newer binary. Never renumber `INIT_VERSION` downward.

### Image Hierarchy and Build System

Templates are YAML definitions (`common/src/main/resources/images/`) with optional parent inheritance forming a chain: `tpl-minimal` -> `tpl-dev` -> `tpl-java`. Building an image auto-builds missing parents. Each definition can set `type` (`container`, `vm`, or `kvm`) which inherits through the parent chain via `inheritTypes()` at `ImageDef.loadAll()` time. VM definitions also support `vm_image_url` and `vm_image_sha256` for a pre-baked VM base image.

`BuildCommand` has two build paths:
- **`buildFromScratch`** (root image, no parent): launches base OS, configures security/DNS/user, installs packages and tools
- **`buildFromParent`** (derived image): copies parent via CoW, applies only the delta (new packages/tools)

For VMs, `buildFromScratch` applies the entire ancestor chain from YAML definitions — parent Incus instances are not needed. `buildChain` detects type changes (container→VM) and skips unnecessary parent rebuilds. Container-specific security config (raw.idmap, nesting, setxattr interception) is skipped for VMs. Tool downloads use a mount-and-copy strategy instead of file push (vsock can't handle large pushes). The `--type` CLI flag overrides the definition's type; `effectiveVm()` resolves the effective VM status considering both the flag and definition.

Package deduplication: `BuildCommand` collects all ancestor packages and subtracts them from the install list so derived images only install what's new.

**Base image version tracking**: The root template (`tpl-minimal`) downloads a pre-baked base image from `Sanne/incus-spawn-images`, whose tag/checksums are baked into `minimal.yaml`. That built-in tag is only an **offline fallback**. When the root def is unpinned (`pinned: false`), `BuildCommand.resolveTrackedBaseImage()` (called at the top of `buildFromScratch` on the root def) fetches the newest release at build time via `baseimage/BaseImageReleases` and swaps in its tag + per-arch container/VM checksums, so a plain build always tracks the latest base image; any network/API failure falls back to the built-in tag with a `note()`. `isx update-base` only manages the *pin* — pinning writes a `pinned: true` user override (`~/.config/incus-spawn/images/minimal.yaml`) with the selected tag and both `image_sha256`+`vm_image_sha256`; `--latest`/menu option 1 just deletes that override to resume build-time tracking (it downloads nothing). `BaseImageReleases.parseSha256Sums()` keys checksums by arch and distinguishes `-vm.tar.xz` from `.tar.xz`. An event-driven CI job (`.github/workflows/update-base-image.yml`) opens a PR to bump the built-in fallback when the images repo publishes a newer release: the images repo (`Sanne/incus-spawn-images`) fires a `base-image-released` `repository_dispatch` carrying the tag + container/VM checksums, so the consumer neither polls nor re-derives them (a manual `workflow_dispatch` backstop re-derives from the release list if a dispatch is missed). This tracking behavior is unrelated to `INIT_VERSION`.

**DNF output and parallelism**: dnf steps render a single animated `TerminalProgress` spinner line instead of flooding the terminal — so isx's own warnings stay visible. Install/upgrade go through `runDnf`, which **streams** dnf's output through a parser (`onDnfLine` + the `DNF_STEP` regex) rather than echoing it: dnf5's non-TTY output prints one `[N/M] <action> <package>` line per completed step (both the download and transaction phases), so the spinner shows live "N/M — current package" feedback (`formatDnfLine`). dnf's non-TTY column truncates the version/arch tail off each NEVRA (and it can't be widened — `COLUMNS`/`terminal_width` are ignored without a TTY, and a PTY only trades the clean per-line format for concurrent ANSI progress-bar redraws), so `shortenNevra` reduces each `name-epoch:ver-rel.arch` to its bare package name for the display detail. Streaming without terminal echo is provided by `Container.execLines` → `IncusClient.shellExecStreaming` → `util/LineOutputStream` (UTF-8 line splitter). COPR-enable and VM rootfs-expansion use `runWithSpinner` (captured exec, no live detail — they're single/short ops); its `runSpinnerWork` wrapper (and `dnfWork`) convert a thrown exception into a recorded `failed` state, because `TerminalProgress` swallows task exceptions — otherwise the step would stay RUNNING and `finishSpinner` would throw a generic message with no cause. The VM rootfs dependency install goes through `dnfCommand(...)` too; `dnf copr enable`/`dnf clean` run plain `dnf` (the download/cache flags don't apply). Full dnf output is printed to stderr only on failure, after the animated line, via the shared `finishSpinner`. `runDnf` still retries once with `--refresh` on failure (the spinner shows "retrying with --refresh"). dnf has no built-in single-line progress mode — `-q` would suppress the very lines we parse — so consuming its native `[N/M]` output is the approach. Shared dnf flags live in `DNF_BASE_OPTS` (built via `dnfCommand(...)`): `keepcache`, `metadata_expire`, `tsflags=nodocs`, and `max_parallel_downloads` (scaled to `CpuInfo.logicalCores()`, capped at dnf's practical max of 20) to speed the download phase; the rpm transaction itself is serial.

**Host repo refresh**: Before building, `HostRepoRefresh` (`git/HostRepoRefresh.java`) fetches host-side git repos matching image definition repos so local-clone optimization uses current objects. Optionally clones missing repos (persisted via `auto-clone-repos` config). `--skip-git-refresh` bypasses the refresh. `update-all` only fetches.

**Parallel repo cloning**: `BuildCommand.cloneRepos()` clones a template's declared repos concurrently, bounded to `CpuInfo.highPerfCores()` (`util/CpuInfo.java` — P-core count via macOS `sysctl`/Linux `cpu_capacity`, else all logical CPUs). `CpuInfo` is the single source of CPU-topology counts: `logicalCores()` (real host count, bypassing the native image's `-R:ActiveProcessorCount` cap; `ResourceLimits.hostProcessorCount()` delegates to it), `performanceCores()` (P/big cores, or 0 when indistinguishable; `VmManager.detectCpus()` uses it), and `highPerfCores()`. When a host-side checkout is available, the clone runs locally from the mounted reference (`git clone --no-hardlinks`) — this copies pack files directly, avoiding the expensive `git repack` that the old `--reference`/dissociate approach required. After the local clone, the remote URL is fixed to the real origin and a `git fetch` picks up any commits added since the last host refresh (usually nothing, so only ref advertisements travel the network). If a specific branch was requested, it is checked out after the fetch supplies the ref. On any failure the local-clone path is discarded and a normal remote clone runs as fallback. Clones and `prime` commands use captured (non-streamed) exec so parallel output doesn't garble; progress renders via `util/TerminalProgress.java`, the shared animated braille-spinner display also used by `HostRepoRefresh`'s parallel fetch and by `BuildCommand`'s dnf operations. Each repo's `prime` command runs in the same worker as soon as that repo's clone finishes (Cloning → Priming within one progress line), so priming pipelines with the remaining clones instead of waiting at a barrier. Incus device add/remove (host-reference mounts) must not run concurrently, so they bracket the parallel section in serial phases: mount-all → clone-and-prime-all-in-parallel → remove-all. Clone/prime failures are aggregated and abort the build; once any repo fails, workers whose clone finishes afterward skip launching their prime (best-effort fail-fast — primes already running finish).

### Host Resources

`HostResourceSetup` (`config/HostResourceSetup.java`) handles sharing host files/directories with containers. Three modes: `readonly` (Incus disk device), `overlay` (overlayfs with container-local writable upper layer), `copy` (baked into template). Applied before tools during build so caches are available. Devices are removed from stopped templates and re-attached at branch time from JSON metadata stored in `user.incus-spawn.host-resources`. Overlay mounts persist across reboots via a systemd service inside the container. VM-specific: virtiofs disk devices are mounted asynchronously by the incus-agent, so overlay mounts poll `mountpoint -q` for up to 15s before overlaying. File-level resources (not directories) fall back to `copy` mode on VMs since disk devices only support directories.

### Terminal Output

All multi-step lifecycle commands use `BuildOutput` (`common/.../util/BuildOutput.java`) for terminal output formatting — not just build/branch but also `vm` (start/stop/resize), `destroy`, `update-all`, `update-base`, `project`, and the shared `VmManager`. This centralizes ANSI constants and step patterns — individual commands should not define their own. Key helpers: `header()` (generic bold bullet header), `buildHeader()`/`branchHeader()` (build/branch-specific), `step()` for complete lines, `stepWithList()` for a header followed by a comma-separated list that wraps at the terminal width with a hanging indent (used for packages, tools, skills), `stepStart()`/`stepDone()`/`stepDone(detail)` for inline completion on slow operations (never leave a `Doing X...` line dangling with its result on a separate line), `note()` for dim informational messages (blank messages are silently skipped), `success()` for green checkmark lines. Headers live in command classes; shared helpers like `VmManager` emit only steps so they nest correctly under whichever header the caller prints. `isx init`'s interactive first-run flow is the one exception (its own style for now). See DESIGN.md "Terminal Output Visual Language" for the full spec.

### Tool System

`ToolSetup` interface with two implementations:
- **YAML tools** (`ToolDef` + `YamlToolSetup`): declarative definitions in `common/src/main/resources/tools/`. Execution order: packages -> downloads -> run -> run_as_user -> files -> verify. Environment variables are declared via `env:` entries and collected centrally by `BuildCommand.writeEnvFile()`.
- **Java tools** (CDI `@Dependent` beans implementing `ToolSetup`): for tools needing programmatic logic (`ClaudeSetup`, `CodexSetup`, `GhSetup`, `PiSetup`, `BobSetup`). Declare env vars via `envEntries(Map<String,String>)` method. Tools can declare a `feature()` to gate themselves behind an opt-in feature flag in `SpawnConfig.features`.

Resolution via `ToolDefLoader` (later overrides earlier): built-in YAML -> user YAML -> search paths -> project-local YAML. Java CDI tools are used as fallback when no YAML tool matches.

Tools can declare runtime actions (`ActionEntry`) shown in the TUI's F9 actions menu and available via `RunCommand` (`isx run`). Both YAML tools (via `actions:` in the YAML) and Java/CDI tools (via `ToolSetup.actions()`) can contribute actions. Templates select a default action via `ImageDef.defaultAction` (`default-action` in YAML), which is run on Enter in the TUI or when executing `isx run <instance>`. The reference format is `tool-name` (single action) or `tool-name:action-id` (multiple actions). `default-action` inherits through the parent chain (child overrides parent) and is intentionally excluded from `contentFingerprint()` so changing it doesn't trigger template rebuilds.

Action resolution logic is centralized in `ActionResolver`, shared by both `ListCommand` (TUI) and `RunCommand` (CLI). `ActionResolver` handles discovering actions from installed tools, resolving default actions from template inheritance chains, finding specific actions by reference, and building `ActionContext` for execution.

**Important**: Built-in YAML files are listed in a hardcoded `BUILTIN_FILES` constant (not classpath scanning) because GraalVM native image makes classpath directory listing unreliable. When adding a built-in image or tool, you must update the corresponding `BUILTIN_FILES` list.

### Environment Variable System

`EnvEntry` (`config/EnvEntry.java`) models a declarative env var with four strategies: `SET`, `SET_IF_UNSET`, `PREPEND`, `APPEND`. Supports backward-compatible raw shell strings via a custom `ListDeserializer` that handles mixed-type YAML lists (strings and maps). Both `ToolDef.env` and `ImageDef.env` use this model.

`EnvResolver` (`config/EnvResolver.java`) collects sourced entries from the template parent chain and all tools, validates consistency (set+set with different values → `EnvConflictException` naming both sources), and generates the shell script for `/etc/profile.d/isx-env.sh`.

`BuildCommand.writeEnvFile()` orchestrates collection: built-in entries (`ISX_CONTAINER`, `ISX_TEMPLATE`) → template chain env → tool `envEntries()`. Called after `runToolSetup()` in both `buildFromScratch` and `buildFromParent`. `linkJavaTrustStores()` runs after `writeEnvFile()` and symlinks any JDK `cacerts` under `/usr/lib/jvm` or `/opt` to the system trust store (`/etc/pki/java/cacerts`), so non-Fedora JDKs (GraalVM, labsjdk, etc.) trust the MITM CA without needing `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`.

### Incus Interaction

`IncusClient` communicates with the Incus daemon via its REST API. On Linux, requests go over a Unix domain socket (`UnixSocketTransport`); on macOS, over a vsock tunnel exposed as a Unix socket (same `UnixSocketTransport`). `IncusApi.tryConnect()` selects Linux Unix sockets → vsock Unix socket; there is no HTTPS fallback (the old HTTPS-over-TCP path was removed — it hit macOS Local Network prompts and VPN socket filters, and two transports made field issues undiagnosable; `HttpsTransport` remains in the tree but is unwired). `IncusApi` handles request serialization, async operation waiting, and WebSocket-based exec (capture, stream, PTY). `Container` is a helper for running commands inside a specific container (`exec`, `runAsUser`, `runInteractive`). The `incus` CLI binary is not required at runtime.

**macOS vsock robustness**: the vfkit vsock tunnel does not reliably propagate connection close/EOF, which drives several design choices (see DESIGN.md "Transport" and appliance/DESIGN.md):
- **Exec completion via `/wait`, not close frames.** `IncusApi.execWebSocket` unifies capture/stream/bidirectional exec and takes the operation `/wait` endpoint (daemon operation state over HTTP) as the authoritative completion + exit-code signal, then drains and force-closes the data sockets — so a lost close frame can't hang exec. Every exec fd is keepalive-pinged; the drain is adaptive.
- **Keep-alive connection cache.** Short request-path calls (`get`/`post`/`/wait`) reuse a warm connection via `requestPooled` → `ConnectionPool`/`KeepAliveConnection` instead of reconnecting per call; the exec WebSocket fds are per-operation and not pooled.
- **Forwarder leak + recovery.** The same close-propagation gap makes the in-VM `socat` forwarder leak connections. A `socat -T` inactivity backstop reaps them; `isx doctor` diagnoses it (host-side connection gauge in `UnixSocketTransport` / `vm status` vs the in-VM `isx-agent`'s socat count, localizing vfkit vs forwarder) and can restart the forwarder via the agent **without rebooting the VM**. `ClientLog` is a file-only (TUI-safe) diagnostic log for expected-but-noisy events like stale-connection recycling. The agent (`appliance/root/usr/local/sbin/isx-agent`, host side `VmAgentClient`) is an allowlisted one-verb-per-connection dispatcher — `ping`, `socat-count`, `sshd-status`, `forwarder-restart`, and `btrfs-usage <pool> [sync]` (returns the pool's `btrfs qgroup show`/`subvolume list` output for disk accounting, since only the in-VM root agent can read the pool; the allowlisted `sync` second token forces a commit first) — intentionally NOT a general guest-exec channel.

**Storage pool awareness**: On a CoW-capable pool (btrfs/zfs/lvm), Incus implements a same-pool `type: copy` as a native snapshot (e.g. `btrfs subvolume snapshot`) — no explicit snapshot API call is needed. Full copies only happen when (1) there is no CoW pool (the `dir` driver rsyncs), or (2) the source's root disk is on a different pool than the copy target (cross-pool migration). `IncusClient.copy()` follows the source's pool via `planCopy()`: if the source's root disk is on a CoW pool, the copy targets the same pool; otherwise it falls back to the first CoW pool or the profile default. `isx branch` and `BuildCommand.buildFromParent()` warn when a copy will be full (non-CoW), and `isx doctor` surfaces both cases — no CoW pool (FAIL with Linux remediation) and instances on non-CoW pools (WARN with rebuild/move guidance). `isCowDriver()` and `rootDiskPoolFromDevices()` are the unit-testable helpers.

### MITM TLS Proxy

`MitmProxy` (in `common/src/main/java/dev/incusspawn/proxy/`) is a TLS-terminating proxy that intercepts HTTPS to specific domains and injects real auth credentials, so containers only hold placeholder values. Key design:
- Listens on gateway IP:18443 (iptables redirects 443->18443 on the bridge)
- Per-domain certs signed by a custom CA (installed in templates during build). The CA lives at `~/.config/incus-spawn/ca.{crt,key}`; leaf certs are persisted by `CertStore` under `~/.config/incus-spawn/certs/` (`<domain>.crt`/`.key`, wildcards as `_wildcard.<domain>`) and reused across proxy restarts, re-minting only on miss/CA-rotation/near-expiry. Persisting is what keeps each leaf's `notBefore` stable: the proxy is relaunched frequently (macOS launchd `KeepAlive`), and re-minting on a host whose clock has jumped ahead of a lagging container clock (e.g. an Incus VM after macOS resume) produced certs the container rejected as "not yet valid". Certs are keyed by domain, never by container (a leaf is a function of `(domain, CA)`), so this composes with future per-container interception, which is a routing/DNS concern. `CertificateAuthority.BACKDATE_MS` backdates `notBefore` as a skew margin for the rare fresh-mint moments.
- Both CA and leaf certs carry RFC 5280 key identifiers: SKI on the CA, SKI + AKI on leaves. Strict validators (OpenSSL 3.5, and so Python 3.13+, which turns on `VERIFY_X509_STRICT` by default) reject a chain without them — including the trust anchor, so leaf-only extensions are not enough. A CA generated before this is re-issued on load over its **existing key** (`reissueWithSki`), which keeps every leaf valid and un-re-minted; the replaced cert is kept as `ca-superseded.crt`. Images stamped with that superseded fingerprint carry a stale-but-not-foreign anchor: `BranchCommand` lets them branch (the new cert is pushed into the instance by `InstancePrep`/`fixContainerCaIfNeeded` on first use) instead of demanding a rebuild the way a real CA rotation does.
- Three auth modes for Anthropic domains (priority: Vertex > OAuth > API key): OAuth mode strips `x-api-key` and injects `Authorization: Bearer <token>` for Claude Pro/Max users; Vertex mode does three-way routing — passthrough for Vertex-formatted requests, standard-to-Vertex translation for `/v1/messages` (using `VERTEX_ALLOWED_FIELDS` body allowlist), and direct forwarding for non-messages endpoints; API key mode replaces `x-api-key` with the real key
- OpenAI support (behind `openai` feature flag): intercepts `api.openai.com` and injects `Authorization: Bearer <openai-api-key>`
- WebSocket passthrough: handles Upgrade requests by establishing an upstream WebSocket connection (with credential injection), then relaying frames bidirectionally with keepalive pings and close-code propagation. Used by Codex CLI for `api.openai.com`
- Caches OCI blobs by SHA256, Maven artifacts by coordinate, and npm tarballs from `registry.npmjs.org` with ETag-based packument verification

### TUI

`ListCommand` is the TUI implementation (~1800 lines) using Tamboui widgets. Two-panel layout (Templates + Instances) with modal dialogs for branching, renaming, and building.

**Disk-space metrics**: An always-present **header band** (`renderHeader`) sits above the panels: a bold accent "brand chip" (` isx ` reverse-video, plus dim version) anchors app identity on the left, and a compact **storage gauge** is right-aligned on the same row when pool usage is available (fed by `IncusClient.getPoolUsageBytes(findUsablePool())`, cached in `poolUsage`, refreshed once per `reloadData()` — never per frame). Gauge fill colour is green/amber/red at the `STORAGE_WARN_PERCENT`/`STORAGE_CRIT_PERCENT` thresholds; at critical it also raises a one-shot status warning. The gauge bar grows with the terminal (`HEADER_BAR_MIN`..`HEADER_BAR_MAX`, ~width/5). Between the two, a quiet **"N running" badge** (`runningSummary`, split by kind — e.g. `● 2 containers, 1 VM running`, counted across `allEntries` by `runningCounts`) fills the gap; it is lower priority than the gauge and is shown only when it fits the leftover space, so it never evicts the gauge. On narrow terminals the badge drops first, then the gauge (then its bar), so the brand always survives; the gauge is simply omitted on `dir` pools that report no usage. Both panels carry a **DISK** column showing per-instance/per-template used bytes.

Per-row disk weight has two models. The Incus API only ever exposes each btrfs subvolume's *exclusive* bytes (`state.disk.<dev>.usage` in the existing `recursion=2` listing, summed by `sumDiskUsage`), and exclusive collapses to ~0 for any subvolume that has a CoW descendant — so it can't show a template's real weight. The accurate figure is btrfs *referenced* (rfer) bytes (a subvolume's full logical size including blocks shared with ancestors), which Incus does not expose. So `BuildCommand.probeReferencedSize()` measures rfer once at build time (templates are immutable and rfer is stable) via `BtrfsUsage.probe()` and `stampReferencedSize()` records it as `user.incus-spawn.disk-referenced` metadata (excluded from `contentFingerprint()`, so it never triggers a rebuild). The TUI reads that metadata for free each reload and, when **every** built template carries the stamp on a btrfs pool (`canUseReferencedModel`), shows each template as a delta from its parent (`applyReferencedTemplateDeltas` → `referencedDelta`): the root template's delta is its own rfer (the base-image weight), derived templates show only what their layer added (e.g. the GraalVM/Maven tools), and instances keep their exclusive usage — for a branch with no descendants that already equals its delta from the template, and it's free from the API. When any built template predates the stamp (cache-only, no backfill) or the pool isn't btrfs, it falls back to `foldBaseWeightIntoRootTemplate()`, which attributes the shared remainder — `sharedBaseBytes(poolUsage.usedBytes, Σ row usage)` — to the single root template (skipped when the root is ambiguous). Either way `baseTemplateName` tracks the template that owns the base weight, driving the `~` prefix and the delete-confirmation note (`cowDeleteNote`, warning the space is shared with everything derived from it).

Instances are mutable, so they are never stamped — an instance row is always live exclusive usage, meaning "space reclaimed by deleting just this row". This makes instance→instance branching (F4 on an instance) safe with no extra bookkeeping: nothing is cached, so deleting a branched-from instance needs no invalidation — the surviving branch's exclusive usage grows to absorb the now-unshared blocks on the next reload. In the pre-deletion state the source's exclusive reads ~0 (its blocks are shared with the descendant, floating in the gauge like any CoW-shared blocks); `cowDeleteNote` warns about this via `hasDescendant(name, rowParentNames())` — if anything was branched/derived from the target (detected from the `Metadata.PARENT` each row records), it flags that deletion frees little while descendants remain. Delta-model parent lookup for *templates* climbs the definitional (YAML) chain via `nearestStampedAncestorRfer` so a deleted intermediate template doesn't corrupt the surviving rows' deltas.

`BtrfsUsage` (in `common`) reads rfer without an Incus API: on **Linux** it runs `sudo -n btrfs qgroup show -re --raw [--sync]`/`subvolume list` against the pool mount (a scoped NOPASSWD sudoers rule is installed by `isx init` — see below); on **macOS** the pool lives in the appliance VM, so it asks the in-VM control agent's `btrfs-usage` verb (the agent runs as root and can read `/var/lib/incus/storage-pools`). Both feed the same `BtrfsUsage.parse()` join (qgroup rfer ⋈ subvolume paths → instance name), which is unit-tested without btrfs. Any failure yields an empty map and the exclusive/fold fallback. `diskCell` renders values as `~3.1G` (or `-` when unknown).

`probe(pool, sync)` has **two flavours**. The plain read (`sync=false`, the default `probe(pool)`) reports committed accounting as-is — cheap, for a future periodic-sampling cadence where a whole-filesystem commit per tick would be wasteful. The `--sync` read (`sync=true`) forces a commit first, so rfer reflects still-uncommitted writes; it's the rare accuracy-critical read, currently only `BuildCommand.probeReferencedSize()` right after a build. Keep the flag/option in step across the three layers or the read breaks: the Java command (`BtrfsUsage`), the `isx-agent` verb (`btrfs-usage <pool> [sync]`, allowlisted second token), and the sudoers rule (which lists **both** command forms). `probeReferencedSize()` measures rfer against the *temp* build name **before** the rebuild's `deleteIfExists`/rename (and `stampReferencedSize()` records it after the rename): deleting a btrfs subvolume marks qgroup accounting inconsistent, so a read taken after the delete (i.e. on every rebuild) returns stale/zero rfer. A missing/zero rfer drops that template's stamp; the delta model tolerates a missing stamp on a *derived* template (`canUseReferencedModel` gates only on every built **root** being stamped — an unstamped derived row falls back to its own exclusive usage, `applyReferencedTemplateDeltas`), but an unstamped root sends the whole display to the shared-base fold (`foldBaseWeightIntoRootTemplate`). To self-heal a missing stamp (pre-feature template, or a build whose stamp failed) without a rebuild, `fillMissingReferencedSizes()` backfills it on reload with a single **live, non-sync** probe — but *only* when there's an actual gap (`hasUnstampedBuiltTemplate`), never overwriting an existing stamp and never forcing a commit, so the "privileged read is rare, not per-refresh" posture holds for a healthy install. The `C` key reclaims space via a two-phase flow: `CleanCommand.scanPool(incus)` discovers reclaimable items (with a "Scanning pool..." progress overlay), then a `CLEAN_CONFIRM` modal always opens showing all three categories (failed builds, unused images, DNF build cache). Actionable categories are checkboxes with counts/sizes (failed builds and unused images pre-checked, DNF cache unchecked); empty categories are shown as disabled dim lines with a short reason (e.g. "none", "all match a template", "no cache volume"). Focus navigation skips disabled categories. When nothing is reclaimable, the modal shows "Pool is clean." with only an Esc/Close hint. On macOS, a dim `isx vm resize` tip appears when pool usage exceeds `STORAGE_WARN_PERCENT`. Space toggles, Enter executes the selected categories via `CleanCommand.cleanPool(incus, builds, images, dnf)`, and the `CLEAN_RESULT` modal shows what was freed.

**Growing the appliance disk (`isx vm resize`, macOS)**: `VmManager.resizeDataDisk()` grows the sparse raw data-disk image (`Environment.vmDataImage()`, the guest's `/dev/vdc` btrfs volume mounted at `/var/lib/incus` that backs the `cow` pool) via `RandomAccessFile.setLength` — grow-only, VM must be stopped. The guest expands btrfs to fill the larger device on the next boot (appliance `rcS` runs `btrfs filesystem resize max /var/lib/incus`, mirroring the existing root-disk resize). `VmCommand.Resize` orchestrates: validate size > current → confirm → stop → grow image → start → wait for Incus → verify the pool total actually grew (warning if the appliance predates the auto-resize `rcS` line). The persistent data disk survives root-disk upgrades, so an isx upgrade that re-extracts the root disk picks up the new `rcS` without losing data.

### Configuration Loading

- `SpawnConfig`: global config from `~/.config/incus-spawn/config.yaml`
- `ImageDef.loadAll()`: discovers all image definitions across resolution layers
- `ToolDefLoader`: discovers tools across resolution layers
- `ProjectConfig`: per-project config from `incus-spawn.yaml` or `.incus-spawn/incus-spawn.yaml`

Resolution order for both images and tools (later overrides earlier): built-in -> user (`~/.config/incus-spawn/`) -> search paths -> project-local (`.incus-spawn/`).

**Name conflicts vs. overrides**: Overriding a definition from a *later* layer is intentional and supported. Two files declaring the same `name:` *within a single directory* (usually a copy-paste that forgot to update `name:`) is always a mistake and is reported as a conflict. `ImageDef.loadAllWithConflicts()` / `ToolDefLoader.conflicts()` return these same-directory collisions (all colliding files, so 3+ are listed together) plus the intentional cross-layer overrides. `isx build` aborts with a message naming the colliding files and refuses to build until you disambiguate; the TUI stays resilient (surfaces the conflict as a status warning but still lists templates); `isx doctor` reports both conflicts (warnings) and cross-layer overrides (informational — this explains the "built image doesn't match the file I'm editing" confusion). Plain `ImageDef.loadAll()` still returns the resolved map (last-writer-wins) and emits a one-line conflict warning via its warnings consumer, so existing callers are unaffected.

### Download Caching

`DownloadCache` handles host-side download caching with SHA256 verification. Archives are downloaded and extracted on the host, then pushed into containers. This avoids needing tar/curl inside containers.

## CI Integration Tests

`.github/workflows/test-integration.yml` runs on every push/PR to `main`. Key jobs:

- **`unit-tests`**: `mvn package` (no Incus required)
- **`build-native-cli`**: builds the CLI native image, uploads artifact
- **`build-native-proxy`**: builds the proxy native image, uploads artifact
- **`integration-tests`**: boots the appliance VM image under QEMU, checks it reaches `ISX READY` and passes an Incus smoke test
- **`isx-integration-tests-jvm`**: installs Incus on Ubuntu 24.04, builds isx from the unit-tests artifact, runs `isx init`, starts the MITM proxy, builds templates (`tpl-minimal`, `tpl-test-podman`, `tpl-test-vm`), then runs test scripts inside branched instances
- **`isx-integration-tests-native`**: same as jvm but uses native binaries from the build-native jobs
- **`fresh-daemon-init`**: verifies `isx init` on a daemon that has never been initialized

Each job runs on its own freshly-provisioned runner, so jobs never inherit each other's Incus state.

`fresh-daemon-init` exists because `isx-integration-tests` applies CI-specific fixups after `isx init`
(e.g. rewiring the default profile's root disk pool) — so it cannot catch `isx init` failing to set up
the profile itself. It installs Incus and creates only the storage pool, with no `admin init`, reproducing
the state where a pool exists but the default profile is empty (every instance creation then fails with
"Failed getting root disk: No root device could be found"). It asserts the profile has a root disk and
a NIC, then launches a real instance — a profile that merely looks right can still name a bad pool.

Note that `isx init` cannot be tested against the QEMU appliance VM on Linux: isx connects to the
*natively installed* Incus over `/run/incus/unix.socket` and the QEMU boot path exposes no vsock
socket, so it would hit the runner's own daemon and report a misleading success (see the guard in
`appliance/test-with-isx.sh`). The appliance also provisions Incus with its own shell script and never
calls `isx init` — the "ensure default profile has a root disk and NIC" invariant is implemented twice,
in `incus-spawn-vm-init` (shell, in-VM) and `IncusClient.ensureDefaultProfileDevices` (Java, host).
Keep the two in sync.

The `isx-integration-tests` job exercises three environments: a container (from `tpl-minimal`), a rootless-podman container (from `tpl-test-podman`), and a VM (from `tpl-test-vm`). Test scripts live in `.github/scripts/`:

- **`test-instance.sh`**: pushed into containers and VMs, tests proxy interception (Maven/GitHub HTTPS), git clone, passwordless sudo, systemd lifecycle, DNS interception, login shell env vars, and TLS certificate quality. Uses `assert()` / `assert_eq()` shell helpers.
- **`test-podman.sh`**: pushed into the podman container, tests rootless podman (pull, run, build).
- **`test-cow-branching.sh`**: run on the host (not inside a container), measures pool `space.used` before/after branching `tpl-minimal` to verify CoW snapshots don't duplicate disk. Asserts the branch lands on the same pool as the template and that pool overhead stays under 20% of template size.

When adding a new end-to-end test, add an `assert` call in the appropriate script under a new numbered section. The test runs as root inside the container; use `su -l agentuser -c "..."` to test user-level behavior. The `tpl-minimal` base image is Fedora with only git, curl, which, procps-ng, and findutils — install extra packages with `dnf install` inside the test if needed.

## Benchmarking

`bench/run.sh` measures native image performance: binary size, startup time, memory (idle and peak RSS), throughput, and latency. See `bench/README.md` for full documentation.

```shell
bench/run.sh                              # Build native image + benchmark
bench/run.sh --skip-build                 # Reuse existing binary
bench/run.sh --label "before-my-change"   # Tag results for comparison
```

Requires Oracle GraalVM with `native-image`, a running Incus daemon, and a working `isx init` setup. Results are saved as JSON to `bench/results/` and automatically compared with the previous run. Use this before and after changes to the proxy, Vert.x configuration, or native image settings to catch regressions.
